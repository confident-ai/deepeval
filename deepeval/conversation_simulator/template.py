            Guidelines:
            1. Use the provided items to generate a coherent, human-readable profile.
            2. Ensure the profile is concise and includes all the information described in the input requirements, seamlessly integrated into a natural format.
            3. Avoid rigidly listing the items; instead, craft the profile as if writing a short and concise bio.

            IMPORTANT: The output must be formatted as a JSON object with a single key `user_profile`, where the value 
            is the generated user profile in {language}.

            Guidelines:
            1. Use the user profile to establish the context, incorporating any relevant personal details (e.g., name, availability, location).
            2. Clearly articulate the user's intent, turning it into a concrete, real-life situation.
            3. The scenario should be written in a natural, narrative tone and provide enough background to understand the user's motivation and interaction goals.
            4. Ensure the scenario is concise but specific enough to describe the context and purpose.

            IMPORTANT: The output must be formatted as a JSON object with a single key `scenario`, where the value is the generated scenario description in {language}.

            Guidelines:
            1. The opening message should clearly convey the user's intent or need within the scenario.
            2. Keep the tone warm, conversational, and natural, as if it’s from a real person seeking assistance.
            3. Avoid providing excessive details upfront; the goal is to initiate the conversation and build rapport, not to solve it in the first message.
            4. The message should be concise, ideally no more than 1-3 sentences.

            Guidelines:
