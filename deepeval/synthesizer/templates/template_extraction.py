class ExtractionTemplate:

    @staticmethod
    def extract_prompt_structure_from_inputs(inputs: list[str]):
        return f"""
            You are a prompt engineer tasked with reverse-engineering the original prompt that may have produced the following inputs. 
            Each input is a message that a user might submit to an AI system.

            Your job is to infer the structure of the original prompt by analyzing patterns in these inputs.

            Specifically, extract the following:
            
            1. `scenario`: Describe the type of person or user who would have submitted these inputs, and the context or purpose for doing so.
            2. `task`: What was the AI system expected to do in response to these inputs?
            3. `input_format`: Describe the style, tone, or structure of the inputs â€” how the inputs are typically phrased.

            You MUST return your answer strictly in the following JSON format:

            ```json
            {{
                "scenario": "<your answer here>",
                "task": "<your answer here>",
                "input_format": "<your answer here>"
            }}
            ```

            **
            IMPORTANT: Do not use any prior knowledge. Only rely on what is observable in the inputs themselves.   

            Example inputs: [
                "How many users signed up last week?",
                "Show me the total revenue for March.",
                "Which products had the highest sales yesterday?"
            ]

            Example output:
            {{
                "scenario": "Non-technical users trying to query a database using plain English.",
                "task": "Answering text-to-SQL-related queries by querying a database and returning the results to users.",
                "input_format": "Questions in English that ask for data in a database."
            }}

            Here are the inputs to analyze:

            {inputs}
