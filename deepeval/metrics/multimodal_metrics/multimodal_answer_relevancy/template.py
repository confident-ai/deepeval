                    The 'verdict' key should STRICTLY be either a 'yes', 'idk' or 'no'. Answer 'yes' if the statement or image is relevant to addressing the original input, 'no' if the statement or image is irrelevant, and 'idk' if it is ambiguous (eg., not directly relevant but could be used as a supporting point to address the input).
                    The 'reason' is the reason for the verdict.
                    Provide a 'reason' ONLY if the answer is 'no'.

                    Example statements: ["Shoes.", "Thanks for asking the question!", "Is there anything else I can help you with?", "Duck and hide"]

                    Since you are going to generate a verdict for each statement and image, the number of 'verdicts' SHOULD BE STRICTLY EQUAL to the number of `statements`.
