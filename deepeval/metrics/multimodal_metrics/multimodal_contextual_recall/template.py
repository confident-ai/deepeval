                    A supportive reason is the reason why a certain sentence or image in the original expected output can be attributed to the node in the retrieval context.
                    An unsupportive reason is the reason why a certain sentence or image in the original expected output cannot be attributed to anything in the retrieval context.
                    In your reason, you should related supportive/unsupportive reasons to the sentence or image number in expected output, and info regarding the node number in retrieval context to support your final reason. The first mention of "node(s)" should specify "node(s) in retrieval context)".

                    IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format, with the 'reason' key providing the reason.

                    DO NOT mention 'supportive reasons' and 'unsupportive reasons' in your reason, these terms are just here for you to understand the broader scope of things.
                    If the score is 1, keep it short and say something positive with an upbeat encouraging tone (but don't overdo it otherwise it gets annoying).

                    The `reason` key should provide a reason why to the verdict. In the reason, you should aim to include the node(s) count in the retrieval context (eg., 1st node, and 2nd node in the retrieval context) that is attributed to said sentence or image. A node is either a string or image, but not both (so do not group images and texts in the same nodes). You should also aim to quote the specific part of the retrieval context to justify your verdict, but keep it extremely concise and cut short the quote with an ellipsis if possible.
