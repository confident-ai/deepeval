In your reason, you should quote data provided in the reasons for irrelevancy and relevant statements to support your point.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format, with the 'reason' key providing the reason.
Example JSON:
{{

If the score is 1, keep it short and say something positive with an upbeat encouraging tone (but don't overdo it otherwise it gets annoying).

You should first extract statements found in the context, which are high level information found in the context, before deciding on a verdict and optionally a reason for each statement.
The 'verdict' key should STRICTLY be either 'yes' or 'no', and states whether the statement is relevant to the input.
Provide a 'reason' ONLY IF verdict is no. You MUST quote the irrelevant parts of the statement to back up your reason.
