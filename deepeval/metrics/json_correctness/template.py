IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format, with the 'reason' key providing the reason.
Example JSON:
{{
    "reason": "The generated Json is <is_valid_json> because <your_reason>."
}}

If the json is not a valid one, your reason MUST compare `Expected Json Schema` and `Generated Json` in your reason. Keep it SHORT and CONCISE while being very FACTUAL and ACTIONABLE.

Generated Json:
{actual_output}

Expected Json Schema:
{expected_schema}

Is Valid Json?
