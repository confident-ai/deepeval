**MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)** is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs through multiple-choice questions. These questions cover 57 subjects such as math, history, law, and ethics. For more information, [visit the MMLU GitHub page](https://github.com/hendrycks/test).

:::tip
`MMLU` covers a broad variety and depth of subjects, and is good at detecting areas where a model **may lack understanding** in a certain topic.

## Arguments

There are two optional arguments when using the `MMLU` benchmark:

- [Optional] `tasks`: a list of tasks (`MMLUTask` enums), specifying which of the **57 subject** areas to evaluate in the language model. By default, this is set to all tasks. Detailed descriptions of the `MMLUTask` enum can be found [here](#tasks).
- [Optional] `n_shots`: the number of "shots" to use for few-shot learning. This is set to **5 by default** and cannot exceed this number.

## Example

The code below evaluates a custom `mistral_7b` model ([click here to learn how to use **ANY** custom LLM](benchmarks-introduction#benchmarking-your-llm)) and assesses its performance on High School Computer Science and Astronomy using 3-shot learning.

```python
from deepeval.benchmarks import MMLU
from deepeval.benchmarks.tasks import MMLUTask

# Define benchmark with specific tasks and shots
benchmark = MMLU(
    tasks=[MMLUTask.HIGH_SCHOOL_COMPUTER_SCIENCE, MMLUTask.ASTRONOMY],
    n_shots=3
)

# Replace 'mistral_7b' with your own custom model
benchmark.evaluate(model=mistral_7b)
print(benchmark.overall_score)
```

The `overall_score` for this benchmark ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 signifies perfect performance and 0 indicates no correct answers. The model's score, based on **exact matching**, is calculated by determining the proportion of multiple-choice questions for which the model produces the precise correct letter answer (e.g. 'A') in relation to the total number of questions.

As a result, utilizing more few-shot prompts (`n_shots`) can greatly improve the model's robustness in generating answers in the exact correct format and boost the overall score.

## MMLU Tasks

The MMLUTask enum classifies the diverse range of subject areas covered in the MMLU benchmark.

```python
from deepeval.benchmarks.tasks import MMLUTask

mm_tasks = [MMLUTask.HIGH_SCHOOL_EUROPEAN_HISTORY]
```
