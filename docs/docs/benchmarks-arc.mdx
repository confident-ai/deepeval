**ARC or AI2 Reasoning Challenge** is a dataset used to benchmark language models' reasoning abilities. The benchmark consists of 8,000 multiple-choice questions from science exams for grades 3 to 9. The dataset includes two modes: _easy_ and _challenge_, with the latter featuring more difficult questions that require advanced reasoning.

## Arguments

There are **THREE** optional arguments when using the `ARC` benchmark:

- [Optional] `n_problems`: the number of problems for model evaluation. By default, this is set all problems available in each benchmark mode.
- [Optional] `n_shots`: the number of examples for few-shot learning. This is **set to 5** by default and **cannot exceed 5**.
- [Optional] mode: a `ARCMode` enum that selects the evaluation mode. This is set to `ARCMode.EASY` by default. `deepeval` currently supports 2 modes: **EASY and CHALLENGE**.

:::info
Both `EASY` and `CHALLENGE` modes consist of **multiple-choice** questions. However, `CHALLENGE` questions are more difficult and require more advanced reasoning.

## Usage

The code below assesses a custom `mistral_7b` model ([click here to learn how to use **ANY** custom LLM](/docs/benchmarks-introduction#benchmarking-your-llm)) on 100 problems in `ARC` in EASY mode.

```python
from deepeval.benchmarks import ARC
from deepeval.benchmarks.modes import ARCMode

# Define benchmark with specific n_problems and n_shots in easy mode
benchmark = ARC(
    n_problems=100,
    n_shots=3,
    mode=ARCMode.EASY
)

# Replace 'mistral_7b' with your own custom model
benchmark.evaluate(model=mistral_7b)
print(benchmark.overall_score)
```

The `overall_score` ranges from 0 to 1, signifying the fraction of accurate predictions across tasks. Both modes' performances are measured using an **exact match** scorer, focusing on the quantity of correct answers.
