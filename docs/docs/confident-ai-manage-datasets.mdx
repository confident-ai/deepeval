## Quick Summary

Confident AI provides your team a centralized place to create and edit evaluation datasets. You can manage evaluation datasets either using `deepeval` or directly on Confident AI.

## Create Your Dataset Using DeepEval

Creating an `EvaluationDataset` on Confident using `deepeval` is a two-step process:

1. Create a dataset locally (same as how you would create a dataset as shown in the [datasets section](evaluation-datasets))
2. Push the created dataset to Confident

### Create A Dataset Locally

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

original_dataset = [
    {
        "input": "What are your operating hours?",
        "actual_output": "...",
        "context": [
            "Our company operates from 10 AM to 6 PM, Monday to Friday.",
            "We are closed on weekends and public holidays.",
            "Our customer service is available 24/7.",
        ],
    },
    {
        "input": "Do you offer free shipping?",
        "actual_output": "...",
        "expected_output": "Yes, we offer free shipping on orders over $50.",
    },
    {
        "input": "What is your return policy?",
        "actual_output": "...",
    },
]

test_cases = []
for datapoint in original_dataset:
    input = datapoint.get("input", None)
    actual_output = datapoint.get("actual_output", None)
    expected_output = datapoint.get("expected_output", None)
    context = datapoint.get("context", None)

    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=input,
        actual_output=actual_output,
        expected_output=expected_output,
        context=context
    )
    test_cases.append(test_case)

dataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=test_cases)
```

### Push Dataset to Confident AI

After creating your `EvaluationDataset`, all you have to do is push it to Confident by providing an `alias` as an unique identifier:

```python
# Provide an alias when pushing a dataset
dataset.push(alias="My Confident Dataset")
```

:::danger
Pushing a dataset to Confident overwrites existing datasets with the same `alias`

## Create Your Dataset on Confident AI

You can alternatively create an evaluation dataset directly on Confident.

1. [Login to Confident.](https://app.confident-ai.com)
2. Find "Datasets" on the left navigation bar to go to the "Datasets" page.
3. Click on the "Create Dataset" button.
4. Enter an "alias", and click "Create". Click on the newly created dataset to create your first golden.
5. In the "Edit Dataset" page, click on the "Actions" button.
6. On the dropdown menu, click on the "Create Golden" button.
7. Create your "Golden", click "Save", and repeat steps 6-8 until youo're done building your dataset.

## What is a Golden?

A "Golden" is what makes up an evaluation dataset and is very similar to a test case in `deepeval`, but they:

- do not require an `actual_output`, so whilst test cases are always ready for evaluation, a golden isn't.
- only exists within an `EvaluationDataset()`, while test cases can be defined anywhere.

We introduced the concept of goldens because it allows you to create evaluation datasets on Confident without needing to pre-computed `actual_output`s. This is especially helpful if you are looking to generate responses from your LLM application at evaluation time.
