<MetricTagsDisplayer custom={true} multimodal={true} />

The multimodal contextual precision metric measures your RAG pipeline's retriever by evaluating whether nodes in your `retrieval_context` that are relevant to the given `input` are ranked higher than irrelevant ones. `deepeval`'s multimodal contextual precision metric is a self-explaining MLLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

:::info
The **Multimodal Contextual Precision** is the multimodal adaptation of DeepEval's [contextual precision metric](/docs/metrics-contextual-precision). It accepts images in addition to text for the `input`, `retrieval_context`, and `expected_output`.
:::

## Required Arguments

To use the `MultimodalContextualPrecisionMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`MLLMTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#mllm-test-case):

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `expected_output`
- `retrieval_context`

The `input` and `actual_output` are required to create an `MLLMTestCase` (and hence required by all metrics) even though they might not be used for metric calculation. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

```python
from deepeval.test_case import MLLMTestCase, MLLMImage
from deepeval.metrics import MultimodalContextualPrecisionMetric
from deepeval import evaluate

metric = MultimodalContextualPrecisionMetric()
m_test_case = MLLMTestCase(
    input=["Tell me about some landmarks in France"],
    actual_output=[
        "France is home to iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower in Paris.",
        MLLMImage(...)
    ],
    expected_output=[
        "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France.",
        MLLMImage(...)
    ],
    retrieval_context=[
        MLLMImage(...),
        "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower built in the late 19th century.",
        MLLMImage(...)
    ],
)


evaluate(test_case=[m_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **SIX** optional parameters when creating a `MultimodalContextualPrecisionMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's Multimodal GPT models to use, **OR** any custom MLLM model of type `DeepEvalBaseMLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4.1'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

### As a standalone

You can also run the `MultimodalContextualPrecisionMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(m_test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

## How Is It Calculated?

The `MultimodalContextualPrecisionMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Multimodal Contextual Precision} = \frac{1}{\text{Number of Relevant Nodes}} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Nodes Up to Position } k}{k} \times r_{k} \right)" />

:::info

- **_k_** is the (i+1)<sup>th</sup> node in the `retrieval_context`
- **_n_** is the length of the `retrieval_context`
- **_r<sub>k</sub>_** is the binary relevance for the k<sup>th</sup> node in the `retrieval_context`. _r<sub>k</sub>_ = 1 for nodes that are relevant, 0 if not.

:::

The `MultimodalContextualPrecisionMetric` first uses an MLLM to determine for each node in the `retrieval_context` whether it is relevant to the `input` based on information in the `expected_output`, before calculating the **weighted cumulative precision** as the contextual precision score. The weighted cumulative precision (WCP) is used because it:

- **Emphasizes on Top Results**: WCP places a stronger emphasis on the relevance of top-ranked results. This emphasis is important because MLLMs tend to give more attention to earlier nodes in the `retrieval_context` (which may cause downstream hallucination if nodes are ranked incorrectly).
- **Rewards Relevant Ordering**: WCP can handle varying degrees of relevance (e.g., "highly relevant", "somewhat relevant", "not relevant"). This is in contrast to metrics like precision, which treats all retrieved nodes as equally important.

A higher multimodal contextual precision score represents a greater ability of the retrieval system to correctly rank relevant nodes higher in the `retrieval_context`.
