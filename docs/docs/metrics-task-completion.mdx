The task completion metric uses LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate how effectively an **LLM agent accomplishes a task**. Task Completion is a self-explaining LLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

:::info
Task Completion analyzes your **agent's full trace** to determine task success, which requires [setting up tracing](/docs/evaluation-llm-tracing).
:::

## Usage

To begin, [set up tracing](/docs/evaluation-llm-tracing) and simply supply the `TaskCompletionMetric()` to your agent's `@observe` tag.

```python
from deepeval.tracing import observe
from deepeval.dataset import Golden, EvaluationDataset
from deepeval.metrics import TaskCompletionMetric

@observe()
def trip_planner_agent(input):
    destination = "Paris"
    days = 2

    @observe()
    def restaurant_finder(city):
        return ["Le Jules Verne", "Angelina Paris", "Septime"]

    @observe()
    def itinerary_generator(destination, days):
        return ["Eiffel Tower", "Louvre Museum", "Montmartre"][:days]

    itinerary = itinerary_generator(destination, days)
    restaurants = restaurant_finder(destination)

    return itinerary + restaurants


# Create dataset
dataset = EvaluationDataset(goldens=[Golden(input="This is a test query")])

# Initialize metric
task_completion = TaskCompletionMetric(threshold=0.7, model="gpt-4o")

# Loop through dataset
for goldens in dataset.evals_iterator(metrics=[task_completion]):
    trip_planner_agent(golden.input)
```

There are **SEVEN** optional parameters when creating a `TaskCompletionMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `task`: a string representing the task to be completed. If no task is supplied, it is automatically inferred from the trace. Defaulted to the `None`
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-a-metric-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `TaskCompletionMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Task Completion Score} = \text{AlignmentScore}(\text{Task}, \text{Outcome})" />

- **Task** and **Outcome** are extracted from the trace (or test case for end-to-end) using an LLM.
- The **Alignment Score** measures how well the outcome aligns with the extracted (or user-provided) task, as judged by an LLM.
