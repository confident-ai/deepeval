Learn how to evaluate different versions of your LLM app using LLM Arena-as-a-Judge in `deepeval`, a comparison-based LLM eval.

## Overview

Instead of comparing LLM outputs using a single-output LLM-as-a-Judge method as seen in previous sections, you can also compare n-pairwise test cases to find the best version of your LLM app. This method although does not provide numerical scores, allows you to more reliably choose the "winning" LLM output for a given set of inputs and outputs.

**In this 5 min quickstart, you'll learn how to:**

- Setup an LLM arena
- Use Arena G-Eval to pick the best performing LLM app

## Prerequisites

- Install `deepeval`

## Setup LLM Arena

In `deepeval`, arena test cases are used to compare two contestants i.e, two models to see which one performs better. Each test case is an arena for different models that are evaluated based on their corresponding `LLMTestCase`

<Timeline>

<TimelineItem title="Create an arena test cases">

Create an `ArenaTestCase` by passing a dictionary of contestants with thier names as keys and their corresponding `LLMTestCase` as values.

```python title="main.py"
from deepeval.test_case import ArenaTestCase, LLMTestCase

test_case = ArenaTestCase(
    contestants={
        "GPT-4": LLMTestCase(
            input='Who wrote the novel "1984"?',
            actual_output="George Orwell",
        ),
        "Claude-4": LLMTestCase(
            input='Who wrote the novel "1984"?',
            actual_output='"1984" was written by George Orwell.',
        ),
        "Gemini 2.0": LLMTestCase(
            input='Who wrote the novel "1984"?',
            actual_output="That dystopian masterpiece was penned by George Orwell 📚",
        ),
        "Deepseek R1": LLMTestCase(
            input='Who wrote the novel "1984"?',
            actual_output="George Orwell is the brilliant mind behind the novel '1984'.",
        ),
    },
)
... # Create more test cases as shown above
```

You can learn more about `LLMTestCase` [here](https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-test-cases).

<TimelineItem title="Define arena metric">

The [`ArenaGEval`](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-arena-g-eval) metric is the only metric that is compatible with `ArenaTestCase`. It picks a winner among the contestants based on the criteria defined.

```python title="main.py"
from deepeval.metrics import ArenaTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams

arena_geval = ArenaGEval(
    name="Friendly",
    criteria="Choose the winner of the more friendly contestant based on the input and actual output",
    evaluation_params=[
        LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT,
        LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT,
    ],
)
```

</TimelineItem>

</Timeline>

✅ Done. You have now successfully created an arena test cases with the contestants and an evaluation crieteria. You can now run evals and find the winner of the contestants.

## Run Your First Arena Evals

Now that you have created an arena with both contestants and metric, you can run evals by using the `compare()` method:

```python {3,11} title="main.py"
from deepeval.test_case import ArenaTestCase, LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import ArenaTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams
from deepeval import compare

test_case = ArenaTestCase(
    contestants={...}, # Use the same pairs you've created before
)

arena_geval = ArenaGEval(...) # Use the same metric you've created before

compare(test_cases=[test_case], metric=arena_geval)
```

You can now run this python file to get your results:

```
python main.py
```

This should let you see the results of the arena as shown below:

```text
Counter({'Gemini 2.0': 5, 'Deepseek R1': 1})
```

These are the number of wins each contestant had in the arena. The sum of all wins will be equal to the number of test cases you provided.

## Next Steps

Now that you have run your first Arena evals, you should:

1. **Customize your metrics**: You can change the criteria of your metric to be more specific to your use-case.
2. **Prepare a dataset**: If you don't have one, [generate one](/docs/synthesizer-introduction) as a starting point to store your inputs as goldens.

The arena metric is only used for picking winners among the contestants, it's not used for evaluating the answers themselves. To evaluate your LLM application on specific use cases you can read the other quickstarts here:
