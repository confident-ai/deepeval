## Quick Summary

Confident AI was designed for LLM teams to quality assure LLM applications from development to production. It is an all-in-one platform that unlocks `deepeval`'s full potential by allowing you to:

- evaluate LLM applications continously in production
- centralize and standardize evaluation datasets on the cloud
- trace and debug LLM applications during evaluation
- keep track of the evaluation history of your LLM application
- generate evaluation-based summary reports for relevant stakeholders

## Why Confident AI?

As you try to evaluate and monitor LLM applications in both development and production environments, you might face several challenges:

- Dataset Quality Assurance: Keeping track of which test cases are ready for evaluation can become cumbersome, and miscommunication between expert data annotators and engineers regarding test case specifics can lead to inefficiencies.
- Experimentation Difficulties: Finding an easy way to experiment with the best LLM system implementations is essential but often challenging.
- Identifying Issues at Scale: Spotting unsatisfactory responses in production at scale can be daunting, especially for a complex LLM system architecture.

Here's a diagram outlining how Confident AI works:

## Login to Confident AI

Everything in `deepeval` is already automatically integrated with Confident AI, including `deepeval`'s [custom metrics](metrics-custom). To start using Confident AI with `deepeval`, simply login in the CLI:

```
deepeval login
```

Follow the instructions displayed on the CLI (to create an account, get your Confident API key, paste it in the CLI), and you're good to go.

:::tip
You can also login directly in Python if you already have a Confident API Key:

```python
deepeval.login_with_confident_api_key("your-confident-api-key")
```

Or, via the CLI:

```python
deepeval login --confident-api-key "your-confident-api-key"
```
