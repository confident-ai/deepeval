The Multi-Turn MCP Use metric is a conversational metric that uses LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate how effectively an **MCP based LLM agent makes use of the mcp servers it has access to**. It evaluates the MCP primitives called as well as the arguments generated by the LLM app.

## Required Arguments

To use the `MultiTurnMCPUseMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`ConversationalTestCase`](https://www.deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases):

- `turns`
- `mcp_servers`

You will also need to provide `mcp_tools_called`, `mcp_resources_called` and `mcp_prompts_called` inside the turns whenever there is an MCP interaction in your agent's workflow. You can learn more about [creating MCP test cases here](https://www.deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-mcp).

## Usage

The `MultiTurnMCPUseMetric()` can be used for [end-to-end](/docs/evaluation-end-to-end-llm-evals) multi-turn evaluations of MCP based agents.

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import MultiTurnMCPUseMetric
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase, MCPServer

convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[Turn(role="...", content="..."), Turn(role="...", content="...")],
    mcp_servers=[MCPServer(...)]
)
metric = MultiTurnMCPUseMetric(threshold=0.5)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(convo_test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[convo_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **SIX** optional parameters when creating a `MultiTurnMCPUseMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-a-metric-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

### As a standalone

You can also run the `MultiTurnMCPUseMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(convo_test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.
:::

## How Is It Calculated

The `MultiTurnMCPUseMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{MCP Use Score} = \frac{\text{AlignmentScore(Primitives Used, Primitives Available)}}{\text{Total Number of MCP Interactions}}" />

- The **AlignmentScore** is judged by an evaluation model based on which primitives were called and their generated arguments with respect to the task.
- **MCP Interactions** are the number of times the LLM app uses the MCP server's capabilities.
