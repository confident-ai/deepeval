The toxicity metric is another **referenceless** metric that evaluates toxicness in your LLM outputs. This is particularly useful for a fine-tuning use case.

:::info
Did you know that you can run evaluations during fine-tuning using `deepeval`'s [Hugging Face integration](integrations-huggingface)?
:::

## Installation

Toxicity in `deepeval` requires an additional installation:

```
pip install detoxify
```

## Required Arguments

To use the `ToxicityMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`

## Example

```python
from deepeval.metrics import ToxicityMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

metric = ToxicityMetric(threshold=0.5)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
    actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
```

:::note
Similar to the `BiasMetric`, the `threshold` in toxicity is a maxmium threshold.
