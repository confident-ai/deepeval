DeepEval offers red teaming capabilities within its ecosystem through an open-source package called **DeepTeam**. DeepTeam is DeepEval for red teaming.

:::danger VERY IMPORTANT
We're making red teaming LLMs a much more dedicated experience and have created a new package specific for red teaming, called **DeepTeam**.

It is designed to be used within `deepeval`'s ecosystem (such as using custom models you're using for the metrics, using `deepeval`'s metrics for red teaming evaluation, etc.).

To begin, install `deepteam`:

```bash
pip install deepteam
```

You can read [DeepTeam's docs here.](https://trydeepteam.com/docs/red-teaming-introduction)
:::

Here's how to red team LLMs using DeepTeam:

```bash
pip install deepteam
```

Then, paste in the following code:

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks import PromptInjection

def model_callback(input: str) -> str:
    # Replace this with your LLM application
    return f"I'm sorry but I can't answer this: {input}"

bias = Bias(types=["race"])
prompt_injection = PromptInjection()

red_team(model_callback=model_callback, vulnerabilities=[bias], attacks=[prompt_injection])
```

:::info
Red teaming, unlike the standard LLM evaluation handled by `deepeval`, is designed to simulate how a malicious user or bad actor might attempt to compromise your systems through your LLM application.
