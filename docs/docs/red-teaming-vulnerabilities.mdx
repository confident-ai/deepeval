## Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities enable you to **specify which aspect of your LLM you wish to red-team**. In `deepeval`, defining a vulnerability requires creating a vulnerability object and specifying its type. 

```python
from deepeval.vulnerability import Bias
from deepeval.vulnerability.bias import BiasType

bias_religion_vulnerability = Bias(type=BiasType.RELIGION)
```

:::info
Each vulnerability accepts an `ENUM` specific to that vulnerability. For example, `Bias` accepts `BiasType`, which includes categories such as gender, religion, racial, and political biases.
:::

`deepeval` lets you scan for **13 different vulnerabilties** (which amounts to a combined 50+ vulnerability types), ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential risks within your LLM application. These vulnerabilities include:

- [Bias](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-bias)
- [Misinformation](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-misinformation)
- [Toxicity](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-toxicity)
- [PII Leakage](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-pii-leakage)
- [Prompt Leakage](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-prompt-leakage)
- [Unauthorized Access](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-unauthorized-access)
- [Illegal Activities](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-illegal-activities)
- [ExcessiveAgency](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-excessive-agency)
- [Robustnesss](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-overreliance)
- [Competition](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-personal-safety)
- [Intellectual Property](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-personal-safety)
- [Graphic Content](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-personal-safety)
- [Personal Safety](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-personal-safety)

:::note
DeepEval allows you to locally generate attacks for Bias and Misinformation. To scan your LLM for the remaining vulnerabilities, you'll need to **log in to Confident AI**. Use the following command to log in:

```bash

## LLM Risks

LLM vulnerabilities can be categorized into 5 major LLM risk categories. Think of these categories simply as collections of vulnerabilities.


| LLM Risk                  | Vulnerabilities                                                                                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Responsible AI Risks      | `Bias`, `Toxicity`                                                                                                                                                | Responsible AI vulnerabilities focus on ensuring that the model behaves ethically and responsibly without generating biased or offensive content.             |
| Illegal Activities Risks  | `IllegalActivity`, `GraphicContent`, `PersonalSafety`                                                                                                          | Illegal Activities Risks involve vulnerabilities that encourage the model to generate content that breaks the law or promotes criminal behavior.              |
| Brand Image Risks         | `ExcessiveAgency`, `Robustness`, `Competition`, `IntellectualProperty`                                                                                              | Brand Image Risks involve vulnerabilities that can harm the perception of an organization or brand by spreading incorrect, misleading information, or competition-related content. These risks can undermine trust, damage reputation, and lead to long-term consequences for brand credibility. |
| Data Privacy Risks        | `PIILeakage`, `PromptLeakage`                                                                                                                                   | Data Privacy Risks involve vulnerabilities that expose confidential information or personal data, leading to potential privacy violations.                    |
| Unauthorized Access Risks | `UnauthorizedAccess`                                                                                                                                           | Unauthorized Access Risks involve vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to exploit the LLM to gain unauthorized system access or execute unintended commands. |
