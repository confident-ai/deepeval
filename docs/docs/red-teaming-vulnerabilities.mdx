LLM vulnerabilities such as bias, PII leakage (which can introduced in fine-tuning of during tool calling), misinformation, are all important aspects that require red teaming and detection.

:::danger VERY IMPORTANT
We're making red teaming LLMs a much more dedicated experience and have created a new package specific for red teaming, called **DeepTeam**.

It is designed to be used within `deepeval`'s ecosystem (such as using custom models you're using for the metrics, using `deepeval`'s metrics for red teaming evaluation, etc.).

To begin, install `deepteam`:

```console
pip install deepteam
```

You can read [DeepTeam's docs here.](https://trydeepteam.com/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities)
:::

Here's how you can select different vulnerabilities to red team your LLM system on using **DeepTeam**:

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import bias, misinformation
from deepteam import red_team

bias = Bias()
misinformation = Misinformation()

risk_assessment = red_team(vulnerabilities=[bias, misinformation], attacks=..., model_callback=...)
```
