The Plan Adherence metric is an agentic metric that extracts the task and plan from your agent's trace which are then used to evaluate **how well your agent has adhered to the plan** in completing the task. It is a self-explaining eval, which means it outputs a reason for its metric score.

:::info
Plan Adherence metric analyzes your **agent's full trace** to extract the plan and analyse agent's execution in adhering to this plan, this requires [setting up tracing](/docs/evaluation-llm-tracing).
:::

## Usage

To begin, [set up tracing](/docs/evaluation-llm-tracing) and simply supply the `PlanAdherenceMetric()` to your agent's `@observe` tag or in the `evals_iterator` method.

```python
from somewhere import llm
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_trace
from deepeval.dataset import Golden, EvaluationDataset
from deepeval.metrics import PlanAdherenceMetric
from deepeval.test_case import ToolCall


@observe
def tool_call(input):
    ...
    return [ToolCall(name="CheckWhether")]

@observe
def agent(input):
    tools = tool_call(input)
    output = llm(input, tools)
    update_current_trace(
        input=input,
        output=output,
        tools_called=tools
    )
    return output


# Create dataset
dataset = EvaluationDataset(goldens=[Golden(input="What's the weather like in SF?")])

# Initialize metric
metric = PlanAdherenceMetric(threshold=0.7, model="gpt-4o")

# Loop through dataset
for golden in dataset.evals_iterator(metrics=[metric]):
    agent(golden.input)
```

There are **SEVEN** optional parameters when creating a `PlanAdherenceMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-a-metric-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

:::info
The `PlanAdherenceMetric` is an agentic trace-only metric, so unlike other `deepeval` metrics, it cannot be used as a standaolne and **MUST** be used in the `evals_iterator` or `observe` decorator.
:::

## How Is It Calculated?

The `PlanAdherenceMetric` score is calculated by following these steps:

- Extract **Task** from the trace, this defines the user's goal or intent for the agent and is actionable.
- Extract **Plan** from the trace, a plan is extracted from the agent's `thinking` or `reasoning`. If there are no statements that clearly define or imply a plan from the trace, the metric passes by default with a score of `1`.
- Evaluate the **agent's execution steps** from the trace and see how accurately the agent has adhered to the plan.

<Equation formula="\text{Plan Adherence Score} = \text{AlignmentScore}(\text{(Task, Plan)}, \text{Execution Steps})" />

- The **Alignment Score** uses an LLM to generate the final score with all the pre-processed and extracted information like plan, task and execution steps.
