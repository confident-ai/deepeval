## Quick Summary

A test case is a blueprint provided by `deepeval` to unit test LLM outputs. There are two types of test cases in `deepeval`: `LLMTestCase` and `ConversationalTestCase`.

:::caution
Throughout this documentation, you should assume the term 'test case' refers to an `LLMTestCase` instead of a `ConversationalTestCase`.
:::

While a `ConversationalTestCase` is a list of messages represented by `LLMTestCase`s, an `LLMTestCase` is the most prominent type of test case in `deepeval` and is based on seven parameters:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- [Optional] `expected_output`
- [Optional] `context`
- [Optional] `retrieval_context`
- [Optional] `tools_called`
- [Optional] `expected_tools`

Here's an example implementation of a test case:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    expected_output="You're eligible for a 30 day refund at no extra cost.",
    actual_output="We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.",
    context=["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."],
    retrieval_context=["Only shoes can be refunded."],
    tools_called=["WebSearch"],
    expected_tools=["WebSearch", "QueryDatabase"]
)
```

:::info
Since `deepeval` is an LLM evaluation framework, the ** `input` and `actual_output` are always mandatory.** However, this does not mean they are necessarily used for evaluation.

Additionally, depending on the specific metric you're evaluating your test cases on, you may or may not require a `retrieval_context`, `expected_output`, `context`, `tools_called`, and/or `expected_tools` as additional parameters. For example, you won't need `expected_output`, `context`, `tools_called`, and `expected_tools` if you're just measuring answer relevancy, but if you're evaluating hallucination you'll have to provide `context` in order for `deepeval` to know what the **ground truth** is.
:::

## LLM Test Case

An `LLMTestCase` in `deepeval` can be used to unit test LLM application (which can just be an LLM itself) outputs, which includes use cases such as RAG and LLM agents. With the exception of conversational metrics, which are metrics to evaluate conversations instead of individual LLM responses, you can use any LLM evaluation metric `deepeval` offers to evaluate an `LLMTestCase`.

:::note
You cannot use conversational metrics to evaluate an `LLMTestCase`. Conveniently, most metrics in `deepeval` are non-conversational.
:::

Keep reading to learn which parameters in an `LLMTestCase` are required to evaluate different aspects of an LLM applications - ranging from pure LLMs, RAG pipelines, and even LLM agents.

### Input

The `input` mimics a user interacting with your LLM application. The input is the direct input to your prompt template, and so **SHOULD NOT CONTAIN** your prompt template.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="Why did the chicken cross the road?",
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    actual_output="Quite frankly, I don't want to know..."
)
```

:::tip

You should **NOT** include prompt templates as part of a test case because hyperparameters such as **prompt templates are independent variables that you try to optimize for** based on the metric scores you get from evaluation.

If you're logged into Confident AI, you can associate hyperparameters such as prompt templates with each test run to easily figure out which prompt template gives the best `actual_output`s for a given `input`:

```console
deepeval login
```

```python title="test_file.py"
import deepeval
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

def test_llm():
    test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")
    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric()
    assert_test(test_case, [answer_relevancy_metric])

# You should aim to make these values dynamic
@deepeval.log_hyperparameters(model="gpt-4o", prompt_template="...")
def hyperparameters():
    # You can also return an empty dict {} if there's no additional parameters to log
    return {
        "temperature": 1,
        "chunk size": 500
    }
```

```console
deepeval test run test_file.py
```

:::

### Actual Output

The `actual_output` is simply what your LLM application returns for a given input. This is what your users are going to interact with. Typically, you would import your LLM application (or parts of it) into your test file, and invoke it at runtime to get the actual output.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

input = "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input)
)
```

:::note
You may also choose to evaluate with precomputed `actual_output`s, instead of generating `actual_output`s at evaluation time.
:::

### Expected Output

The `expected_output` is literally what you would want the ideal output to be. Note that this parameter is **optional** depending on the metric you want to evaluate.

The expected output doesn't have to exactly match the actual output in order for your test case to pass since `deepeval` uses a variety of methods to evaluate non-deterministic LLM outputs. We'll go into more details [in the metrics section.](metrics-introduction)

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

input = "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
    expected_output="To get to the other side!"
)
```

### Context

The `context` is an **optional** parameter that represents additional data received by your LLM application as supplementary sources of golden truth. You can view it as the ideal segment of your knowledge base relevant to a specific input. Context allows your LLM to generate customized outputs that are outside the scope of the data it was trained on.

In RAG applications, contextual information is typically stored in your selected vector database, which is represented by `retrieval_context` in an `LLMTestCase` and is not to be confused with `context`. Conversely, for a fine-tuning use case, this data is usually found in training datasets used to fine-tune your model. Providing the appropriate contextual information when constructing your evaluation dataset is one of the most challenging part of evaluating LLMs, since data in your knowledge base can constantly be changing.

Unlike other parameters, a context accepts a list of strings.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

input = "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
    expected_output="To get to the other side!",
    context=["The chicken wanted to cross the road."]
)
```

:::note
Often times people confuse `expected_output` with `context` since due to their similar level of factual accuracy. However, while both are (or should be) factually correct, `expected_output` also takes aspects like tone and linguistic patterns into account, whereas context is strictly factual.
:::

### Retrieval Context

The `retrieval_context` is an **optional** parameter that represents your RAG pipeline's retrieval results at runtime. By providing `retrieval_context`, you can determine how well your retriever is performing using `context` as a benchmark.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

input = "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
    expected_output="To get to the other side!",
    context=["The chicken wanted to cross the road."],
    retrieval_context=["The chicken liked the other side of the road better"]
)
```

:::note
Remember, `context` is the ideal retrieval results for a given input and typically come from your evaluation dataset, whereas `retrieval_context` is your LLM application's actual retrieval results. So, while they might look similar at times, they are not the same.
:::

### Tools Called

The `tools_called` parameter is an **optional** parameter that represents the tools your LLM agent actually invoked during execution. By providing `tools_called`, you can evaluate how effectively your LLM agent utilized the tools available to it.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot


test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="Why did the chicken cross the road?",
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
    # Replace this with the tools that were actually used
    tools_called=["WebSearch", "DatabaseQuery"]
)
```

:::note
`tools_called` and `expected_tools` are LLM test case parameters that are utilized only in **agentic evaluation metrics**. These parameters allow you to assess the [tool usage correctness](metrics-tool-correctness) of your LLM application and ensure that it meets the expected tool usage standards.
:::

### Expected Tools

The `expected_tools` parameter is an **optional** parameter that represents the tools that ideally should have been used to generate the output. By providing `expected_tools`, you can assess whether your LLM application used the tools you anticipated for optimal performance.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

input = "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
    # Replace this with the tools that were actually used
    tools_called=["WebSearch", "DatabaseQuery"],
    expected_tools=["DatabaseQuery"]
)
```

## Conversational Test Case

A `ConversationalTestCase` in `deepeval` is simply a list of conversation `turns` represented by a list of `LLMTestCase`s. While an `LLMTestCase` represents an individual LLM system interaction, a `ConversationalTestCase` encapsulates a series of `LLMTestCase`s that make up an LLM-based conversation. This is particular useful if you're looking to for example evaluate a conversation between a user and an LLM-based chatbot.

While you cannot use a conversational metric on an `LLMTestCase`, a `ConversationalTestCase` can be evaluated using **both non-conversational and conversational metrics.**

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, ConversationalTestCase

llm_test_case = LLMTestCase(
    # Replace this with your user input
    input="Why did the chicken cross the road?",
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    actual_output="Quite frankly, I don't want to know..."
)

test_case = ConversationalTestCase(turns=[llm_test_case])
```

:::note
Similar to how the term 'test case' refers to an `LLMTestCase` if not explicitly specified, the term 'metrics' also refer to non-conversational metrics throughout `deepeval`.
:::

### Turns

The `turns` parameter is a list of `LLMTestCase`s and is basically a list of messages/exchanges in a user-LLM conversation. Different conversational metrics will require different LLM test case parameters for evaluation, while regular LLM system metrics will take the last `LLMTestCase` in a turn to carry out evaluation.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, ConversationalTestCase

test_case = ConversationalTestCase(turns=[LLMTestCase(...)])
```

:::tip Did you know?
You can apply both non-conversational and conversational metrics to a `ConversationalTestCase`. Conversational metrics evaluate the entire conversational as a whole, and non-conversational metrics (which are metrics used for individual `LLMTestCase`s), when applied to a `ConversationalTestCase`, will evaluate the **last** turn in a `ConversationalTestCase`. This is because it is more useful to evaluate the last best LLM `actual_output` given the previous conversation context, instead of all individual `turns` in a `ConversationalTestCase`.
:::

### Chatbot Role

The `chatbot_role` parameter is an **optional** parameter that specifies what role the chatbot is supposed to play. This is currently only required for the `RoleAdherenceMetric`, where it is particularly useful for a role-playing evaluation use case.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, ConversationalTestCase

test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    chatbot_role="...",
    turns=[LLMTestCase(...)]
)
```

## MLLM Test Case

An `MLLMTestCase` in deepeval is designed to unit test outputs from MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) applications. Unlike an `LLMTestCase`, which only handles textual parameters, an `MLLMTestCase` accepts both text and image inputs and outputs. This is particularly useful for evaluating tasks such as text-to-image generation or MLLM-driven image editing.

:::caution
You may only evaluate `MLLMTestCase`s using multimodal metrics such as `VIEScore`.
:::

```python
from deepeval.test_case import MLLMTestCase, MLLMImage

mllm_test_case = MLLMTestCase(
    # Replace this with your user input
    input=["Change the color of the shoes to blue.", MLLMImage(url="./shoes.png", local=True)]
    # Replace this with your actual MLLM application
    actual_output=["The original image of red shoes now shows the shoes in blue.", MLLMImage(url="https://shoe-images.com/edited-shoes", local=False)]
)
```

### Input

The `input` mimics a user interacting with your MLLM application. Like an `LLMTestCase` input, an `MLLMTestCase` input is the direct input to your prompt template, and so **SHOULD NOT CONTAIN** your prompt template.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import MLLMTestCase, MLLMImage

mllm_test_case = MLLMTestCase(
    input=["Change the color of the shoes to blue.", MLLMImage(url="./shoes.png", local=True)]
)
```

:::info
The `input` parameter accepts a list of strings and `MLLMImage`s, which is a class specific `deepeval`. The `MLLMImage` class accepts an image path and automatically sets the `local` attribute to `true` or `false` depending on whether the image is locally stored or hosted online. By default, `local` is set to `false`.

````python
### Example:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import MLLMImage

# Example of using the MLLMImage class
image_input = MLLMImage(image_path="path/to/image.jpg")

# image_input.local will automatically be set to `true` if the image is local
# and `false` if the image is hosted online.
````

:::

### Actual Output

The actual_output is simply what your MLLM application returns for a given input. Similarly, it also accepts a list of strings and `MLLMImage`s.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import MLLMTestCase, MLLMImage

mllm_test_case = MLLMTestCase(
    input=["Change the color of the shoes to blue.", MLLMImage(url="./shoes.png", local=True)],
    actual_output=["The original image of red shoes now shows the shoes in blue.", MLLMImage(url="https://shoe-images.com/edited-shoes", local=False)]
)
```

## Assert A Test Case

Before we begin going through the final sections, we highly recommend you to login to [Confident AI](https://confident-ai.com) (the platform powering deepeval) via the CLI. This way, you can keep track of all evaluation results generated each time you execute `deepeval test run`.

```
deepeval login
```

Similar to Pytest, `deepeval` allows you to assert any test case you create by calling the `assert_test` function by running `deepeval test run` via the CLI.

**A test case passes only if all metrics passes.** Depending on the metric, a combination of `input`, `actual_output`, `expected_output`, `context`, and `retrieval_context` is used to ascertain whether their criterion have been met.

```python title="test_assert_example.py"
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot
import deepeval
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

def test_assert_example():
    input = "Why did the chicken cross the road?"
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=input,
        actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
        context=["The chicken wanted to cross the road."],
    )
    metric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.7)
    assert_test(test_case, metrics=[metric])


# Optional. Log hyperparameters to pick the best hyperparameter for your LLM application
# using Confident AI. (run `deepeval login` in the CLI to login)
@deepeval.log_hyperparameters(model="gpt-4", prompt_template="...")
def hyperparameters():
    # Return a dict to log additional hyperparameters.
    # You can also return an empty dict {} if there's no additional parameters to log
    return {
        "temperature": 1,
        "chunk size": 500
    }
```

There are two mandatory and one optional parameter when calling the `assert_test()` function:

- `test_case`: an `LLMTestCase`
- `metrics`: a list of metrics of type `BaseMetric`
- [Optional] `run_async`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables concurrent evaluation of all metrics. Defaulted to `True`.

:::info
The `run_async` parameter overrides the `async_mode` property of all metrics being evaluated. The `async_mode` property, as you'll learn later in the [metrics section](metrics-introduction), determines whether each metric can execute asynchronously.
:::

To execute the test cases, run `deepeval test run` via the CLI, which uses `deepeval`'s Pytest integration under the hood to execute these tests. You can also include an optional `-n` flag follow by a number (that determines the number of processes that will be used) to run tests in parallel.

```console
deepeval test run test_assert_example.py -n 4
```

## Evaluate Test Cases in Bulk

Lastly, `deepeval` offers an `evaluate` function to evaluate multiple test cases at once, which similar to `assert_test` but without the need for Pytest or the CLI.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
    context=["The chicken wanted to cross the road."],
)

metric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.7)
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

There are two mandatory and ten optional arguments when calling the `evaluate()` function:

- `test_cases`: a list of `LLMTestCase`s **OR** `ConversationalTestCase`s, or an `EvaluationDataset`. You cannot evaluate `LLMTestCase`/`MLLMTestCase`s and `ConversationalTestCase`s in the same test run.
- `metrics`: a list of metrics of type `BaseMetric`.
- [Optional] `hyperparameters`: a dict of type `dict[str, Union[str, int, float]]`. You can log any arbitrary hyperparameter associated with this test run to pick the best hyperparameters for your LLM application on Confident AI.
- [Optional] `run_async`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables concurrent evaluation of test cases **AND** metrics. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `throttle_value`: an integer that determines how long (in seconds) to throttle the evaluation of each test case. You can increase this value if your evaluation model is running into rate limit errors. Defaulted to 0.
- [Optional] `skip_on_missing_params`: a boolean which when set to `True`, skips all metric executions for test cases with missing parameters. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `ignore_errors`: a boolean which when set to `True`, ignores all exceptions raised during metrics execution for each test case. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a optional boolean which when **IS NOT** `None`, overrides each [metric's `verbose_mode` value](metrics-introduction#debugging-a-metric). Defaulted to `None`.
- [Optional] `write_cache`: a boolean which when set to `True`, uses writes test run results to **DISK**. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `use_cache`: a boolean which when set to `True`, uses cached test run results instead. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `show_indicator`: a boolean which when set to `True`, shows the evaluation progress indicator for each individual metric. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `print_results`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the result of each evaluation. Defaulted to `True`.

:::tip DID YOU KNOW?
Similar to `assert_test`, `evaluate` allows you to log and view test results and the hyperparameters associated with each on Confident AI.

```console
deepeval login
```

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
...

evaluate(
    test_cases=[test_case],
    metrics=[metric],
    hyperparameters={"model": "gpt4o", "prompt template": "..."}
)
```

For more examples of `evaluate`, visit the [datasets section](evaluation-datasets).

## Labeling Test Cases for Confident AI

If you're using Confident AI, the optional `name` parameter allows you to provide a string identifier to label `LLMTestCase`s and `ConversationalTestCase`s for you to easily search and filter for on Confident AI. This is particularly useful if you're importing test cases from an external datasource.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, ConversationalTestCase

test_case = LLMTestCase(name="my-external-unique-id", ...)
convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(name="my-external-unique-id", ...)
```
