## Quick Summary

A test case is a blueprint provided by `deepeval` to unit test LLM outputs based on five parameters:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- [Optional] `expected_output`
- [Optional] `context`
- [Optional] `retrieval_context`

Here's an example implementation of a test case:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    expected_output="You're eligible for a 30 day refund at no extra cost.",
    actual_output="We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.",
    context=["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."],
    retrieval_context=["Only shoes can be refunded."],
)
```

:::info
Since `deepeval` is an LLM evaluation framework, the ** `input` and `actual_output` are always mandatory.** However, this does not mean they are necessarily used for evaluation.

Additionally, depending on the specific metric you're evaluating your test cases on, you may or may not require a `retrieval_context`, `expected_output` and/or `context` as additional parameters. For example, you won't need `expected_output` and `context` if you're just measuring answer relevancy, but if you're evaluating hallucination you'll have to provide `context` in order for `deepeval` to know what the **ground truth** is.
:::

## Input

The `input` mimics a user interacting with your LLM application. The input is the direct input to your prompt template, and so **SHOULD NOT CONTAIN** your prompt template.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="Why did the chicken cross the road?",
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    actual_output="Quite frankly, I don't want to know..."
)
```

:::tip

You should **NOT** include prompt templates as part of a test case because hyperparameters such as **prompt templates are independent variables that you try to optimize for** based on the metric scores you get from evaluation.

If you're logged into Confident AI, you can associate hyperparameters such as prompt templates with each test run to easily figure out which prompt template gives the best `actual_output`s for a given `input`:

```console
deepeval login
```

```python title="test_file.py"
import deepeval
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

def test_llm():
    test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")
    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric()
    assert_test(test_case, [answer_relevancy_metric])

# You should aim to make these values dynamic
@deepeval.log_hyperparameters(model="gpt-4o", prompt_template="...")
def hyperparameters():
    # You can also return an empty dict {} if there's no additional parameters to log
    return {
        "temperature": 1,
        "chunk size": 500
    }
```

```console
deepeval test run test_file.py
```

:::

## Actual Output

The `actual_output` is simply what your LLM application returns for a given input. This is what your users are going to interact with. Typcailly, you would import your LLM application (or parts of it) into your test file, and invoke it at runtime to get the actual output.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

input = "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input)
)
```

:::note
You may also choose to evaluate with precomputed `actual_output`s, instead of generating `actual_output`s at evaluation time.
:::

## Expected Output

The `expected_output` is literally what you would want the ideal output to be. Note that this parameter is **optional** depending on the metric you want to evaluate.

The expected output doesn't have to exactly match the actual output in order for your test case to pass since `deepeval` uses a variety of methods to evaluate non-deterministic LLM outputs. We'll go into more details [in the metrics section.](metrics-introduction)

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

input = "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
    expected_output="To get to the other side!"
)
```

## Context

The `context` is an **optional** parameter that represents additional data received by your LLM application as supplementary sources of golden truth. You can view it as the ideal segment of your knowledge base relevant to a specific input. Context allows your LLM to generate customized outputs that are outside the scope of the data it was trained on.

In RAG applications, contextual information is typically stored in your selected vector database, which is represented by `retrieval_context` in an `LLMTestCase` and is not to be confused with `context`. Conversely, for a fine-tuning use case, this data is usually found in training datasets used to fine-tune your model. Providing the appropriate contextual information when constructing your evaluation dataset is one of the most challenging part of evaluating LLMs, since data in your knowledge base can constantly be changing.

Unlike other parameters, a context accepts a list of strings.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

input = "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
    expected_output="To get to the other side!",
    context=["The chicken wanted to cross the road."]
)
```

:::note
Often times people confuse `expected_output` with `context` since due to their similar level of factual accuracy. However, while both are (or should be) factually correct, `expected_output` also takes aspects like tone and linguistic patterns into account, whereas context is strictly factual.
:::

## Retrieval Context

The `retrieval_context` is an **optional** parameter that represents your RAG pipeline's retrieval results at runtime. By providing `retrieval_context`, you can determine how well your retriever is performing using `context` as a benchmark.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

input = "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
    expected_output="To get to the other side!",
    context=["The chicken wanted to cross the road."],
    retrieval_context=["The chicken liked the other side of the road better"]
)
```

:::note
Remember, `context` is the ideal retrieval results for a given input and typically come from your evaluation dataset, whereas `retrieval_context` is your LLM application's actual retrieval results. So, while they might look similar at times, they are not the same.
:::

## Assert A Test Case

Before we begin going through the final sections, we highly recommend you to login to [Confident AI](https://confident-ai.com) (the platform powering deepeval) via the CLI. This way, you can keep track of all evaluation results generated each time you execute `deepeval test run`.

```
deepeval login
```

Similar to Pytest, `deepeval` allows you to assert any test case you create by calling the `assert_test` function by running `deepeval test run` via the CLI.

**A test case passes only if all metrics passess.** Depending on the metric, a combination of `input`, `actual_output`, `expected_output`, `context`, and `retrieval_context` is used to ascertain whether their criterion have been met.

```python title="test_assert_example.py"
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

def test_assert_example():
    input = "Why did the chicken cross the road?"
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=input,
        actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
        context=["The chicken wanted to cross the road."],
    )
    metric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.7)
    assert_test(test_case, metrics=[metric])
```

There are two mandatory and one optional parameter when calling the `assert_test()` function:

- `test_case`: an `LLMTestCase`
- `metrics`: a list of metrics of type `BaseMetric`
- [Optional] `run_async`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables concurrent evaluation of all metrics. Defaulted to `True`.

:::info
The `run_async` parameter overrides the `async_mode` property of all metrics being evaluated. The `async_mode` property, as you'll learn later in the [metrics section](metrics-introduction), determines whether each metric can execute asynchronously.
:::

To execute the test cases, run `deepeval test run` via the CLI, which uses `deepeval`'s Pytest integration under the hood to execute these tests. You can also include an optional `-n` flag follow by a number (that determines the number of processes that will be used) to run tests in parallel.

```console
deepeval test run test_assert_example.py -n 4
```

## Evaluate Test Cases in Bulk

Lastly, `deepeval` offers an `evaluate` function to evaluate multiple test cases at once, which similar to `assert_test` but without the need for Pytest or the CLI.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=chatbot.run(input),
    context=["The chicken wanted to cross the road."],
)

metric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.7)
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

There are two mandatory and four optional arguments when calling the `evaluate()` function:

- `test_case`: an `LLMTestCase`
- `metrics`: a list of metrics of type `BaseMetric`
- [Optional] `run_async`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables concurrent evaluation of all metrics. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `ignore_errors`: a boolean which when set to `True`, ignores all exceptions raised during metrics execution for eac test case. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `write_cache`: a boolean which when set to `True`, uses writes test run results to **DISK**. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `use_cache`: a boolean which when set to `True`, uses cached test run results instead. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `show_indicator`: a boolean which when set to `True`, shows the progress indicator for each individual metric. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `print_results`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the result of each evaluation. Defaulted to `True`.

Similar to `assert_test`, `evaluate` allows you to log and view test results on Confident AI. For more examples of `evaluate`, visit the [datasets section](evaluation-datasets).
