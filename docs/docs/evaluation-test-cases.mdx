## Quick Summary

A test case is a blueprint provided by `deepeval` to unit test LLM outputs based on five parameters:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- [Optional] `expected_output`
- [Optional] `context`
- [Optional] `retrieval_context`

Except for `actual_output`, all parameters should originate from your evaluation dataset (if you have one). Here's an example implementation of a test case:

```python
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    expected_output = "You're eligible for a 30 day refund at no extra cost.",
    actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.",
    context = ["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]
    retrieval_context = ["Only shoes can be refunded."]
)
```

**Note that only `input` and `actual_output` is mandatory.**

However, depending on the specific metric you're evaluating your test cases on, you may or may not require a `retrieval_context`, `expected_output` and/or `context` as additional parameters. For example, you won't need `expected_output` and `context` if you're just measuring answer relevancy, but if you're evaluating hallucination you'll have to provide `context` in order for `deepeval` to know what the **ground truth** is.

Let's go through the purpsoe of each parameter.

## Input

An input mimics a user interacting with your LLM application. The input is usually a prompt composed of dynamic data embedded in a prompt template.

```python
prompt_template = """
    Impersonate a dog when replying to the text below.

    {text}
"""

prompt = prompt_template.format(text="Who's a good boy?")

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=prompt,
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    actual_output="ruff ruff ruff"
)
```

## Actual Output

An actual output is simply the output your LLM application returns for a given input. This is what your users are going to interact with. Typcailly, you would import your LLM application (or parts of it) into your test file, and invoke it at runtime to get the actual output.

Expanding on the previous example:

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

prompt_template = """
    Impersonate a dog when replying to the text below.

    {text}
"""

prompt = prompt_template.format(text="Who's a good boy?")

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=prompt,
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    actual_output=chatbot.run(prompt)
)

```

## Expected Output

An expected output is literally what you would want the ideal output to be. Note that this parameter is **optional** depending on the metric you want to evaluate.

The expected output doesn't have to exactly match the actual output in order for your test case to pass since `deepeval` uses a variety of methods to evaluate non-deterministic LLM outputs. We'll go into more details [in the metrics section.](evaluation-metrics)

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

prompt_template = """
    Impersonate a dog when replying to the text below.

    {text}
"""

prompt = prompt_template.format(text="Who's a good boy?")

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=prompt,
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    actual_output=chatbot.run(prompt),
    expected_output="Me, ruff!"
)
```

## Context

The `context` is an **optional** parameter that represents additional data received by your LLM application as supplementary sources of golden truth. You can view it as the ideal segment of your knowledge base relevant to a specific input. Context allows your LLM to generate customized outputs that are outside the scope of the data it was trained on.

In RAG applications, contextual information is typically stored in your selected vector database. Conversely, for a fine-tuning use case, this data is usually found in training datasets used to fine-tune your model. Providing the appropriate contextual information when constructing your evaluation dataset is one of the most challenging part of evaluating LLMs, since data in your knowledge base can constantly be changing.

Unlike other parameters, a context accepts a list of strings.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

prompt_template = """
    Impersonate a dog named Rocky when replying to the text below.

    {text}
"""

prompt = prompt_template.format(text="Who's a good boy?")

context = ["Rocky is a good boy."]

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=prompt,
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    actual_output=chatbot.run(prompt),
    expected_output="Me, ruff!",
    context=context
)
```

:::note
Often times people confuse `expected_output` with `context` since due to their similar level of factual accuracy. However, while both are (or should be) factually correct, `expected_output` also takes aspects like tone and linguistic patterns into account, whereas context is strictly factual.
:::

## Retrieval Context

The `retrieval_context` is an **optional** parameter that represents your RAG pipeline's retrieval results at runtime. By providing `retrieval_context`, you can determine how well your retriever is performing using `context` as a benchmark.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot

prompt_template = """
    Impersonate a dog named Rocky when replying to the text below.

    {text}
"""

prompt = prompt_template.format(text="Who's a good boy?")

context = ["Rocky is a good boy."]

# Replace this with the actual retrieved context from your RAG pipeline
retrieval_context = ["Rocky is a good cat."]

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=prompt,
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    actual_output=chatbot.run(prompt),
    expected_output="Me, ruff!",
    context=context,
    retrieval_context=retrieval_context
)
```

:::note
Remember, `context` is the ideal retrieval results for a given input and typically come from your evaluation dataset, whereas `retrieval_context` is your LLM application's actual retrieval results.

## Run A Test Case

`deepeval` offers an option to quickly run a test case without going through the CLI.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot
from deepeval import run_test
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

prompt_template = """
    Impersonate a dog named Rocky when replying to the text below.

    {text}
"""

prompt = prompt_template.format(text="Who's a good boy?")
context = ["Rocky is a good boy."]

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=prompt,
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    actual_output=chatbot.run(prompt),
    expected_output="Me, ruff!",
    context=context
)

metric = HallucinationMetric(minimum_score=0.7)
run_test(test_case, [metric])
```

## Assert Test Cases

Before we begin going through the final sections, we highly recommend you to login to [Confident AI](https://confident-ai.com) (the platform powering deepeval) via the CLI. This way, you can keep track of all evaluation results generated each time you execute `deepeval test run`.

```
deepeval login
```

Similar to Pytest, `deepeval` allows you to assert any test case you create by calling the `assert_test` function by running `deepeval test run` via the CLI. `assert_test` takes two mandatory arguments:

- `test_case`: an `LLMTestCase`
- `metrics`: a list of metrics

A test case passes only if all metrics meet their respective evaluation criterion. Depending on the metric, a combination of `input`, `actual_output`, `expected_output`, `context`, and `retrieval_context` is used to ascertain whether their criterion have been met.

```python title="test_assert_example.py"
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

prompt_template = """
    Impersonate a dog named Rocky when replying to the text below.

    {text}
"""

def test_case_1():
    prompt = prompt_template.format(text="Who's a good boy?")
    context = ["Rocky is a good boy."]

    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=prompt,
        # Replace this with your actual LLM application
        actual_output=chatbot.run(prompt),
        expected_output="Me, ruff!",
        context=context
    )
    metric = HallucinationMetric(minimum_score=0.7)
    assert_test(test_case, metrics=[metric])

def test_case_2():
    prompt = prompt_template.format(text="Who's a good boy?")
    context = ["Rocky is a good boy."]

    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=prompt,
        # Replace this with your actual LLM application
        actual_output=chatbot.run(prompt),
        expected_output="Me, ruff!",
        context=context
    )
    metric = HallucinationMetric(minimum_score=0.7)
    assert_test(test_case, metrics=[metric])
```

In the CLI, run the command `deepeval test run`, which uses Pytest under the hood. You can also include an optional `-n` flag follow by a number (that determines the number of processes that will be used) to run tests in parallel.

```console
deepeval test run test_assert_example.py -n 4
```

## Evaluate Test Cases in Bulk

Lastly, `deepeval` offers an `evaluate` function to evaluate multiple test cases at once, which similar to `assert_test` but without the need for Pytest or the CLI.

```python
# A hypothetical LLM application example
import chatbot
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

prompt_template = """
    Impersonate a dog named Rocky when replying to the text below.

    {text}
"""

prompt = prompt_template.format(text="Who's a good boy?")
context = ["Rocky is a good boy."]

first_test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=prompt,
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    actual_output=chatbot.run(prompt),
    expected_output="Me, ruff!",
    context=context
)

second_test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=prompt,
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    actual_output=chatbot.run(prompt),
    expected_output="Me, ruff!",
    context=context
)

test_cases = [first_test_case, second_test_case]

metric = HallucinationMetric(minimum_score=0.7)
evaluate(test_cases, [metric])
```

Similar to `assert_test`, `evaluate` allows you to log and view test results on Confident AI. For more examples of `evalute`, visit the [datasets section](evaluation-datasets).
