**DeepEval** is an open-source evaluation framework for Python, that makes it easy to build
and iterate on LLM applications with the following principles in mind:

- Easily "unit test" LLM outputs in a similar way to Pytest.
- Leverage various out-of-the-box LLM-evaluated and classic evaluation metrics.
- Define evaluation datasets in Python code.
- Metrics are simple to customize.
- [alpha] Bring evaluation into production using Python decorators.

## Setup A Python Environement

Go to the root directory of your project and create a virtual environement (if you don't already have one). In the CLI, run:

```console
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Installation

In your newly created virtual environement, run:

```console.log
pip install -U deepeval
```

You can also keep track of all evaluation results by logging into our [in all one evaluation platform](https://confident-ai.com), and use Confident AI's [proprietary LLM evaluation agent](metrics-judgemental) for evaluation:

```console
deepeval login
```

## Create Your First Test Case

Run `touch test_example.py` to create a test file in your root directory. Open `test_example.py` and paste in your first test case:

```python title="test_example.py"
import pytest
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

def test_hallucination():
    input = "What if these shoes don't fit?"
    context = ["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]

    # Replace this with the actual output of your LLM application
    actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."
    hallucination_metric = HallucinationMetric(minimum_score=0.7)
    test_case = LLMTestCase(input=input, actual_output=actual_output, context=context)
    assert_test(test_case, [hallucination_metric])
```

Run `deepeval test run` from the root directory of your project:

```console
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

**Congratulations! Your test case should have passed ✅** Let's breakdown what happened.

- The variable `input` mimics a user input, and `actual_output` is a placeholder for what your application's supposed to output based on this input.
- The variable `context` contains the relevant information from your knowledge base, and `HallucinationMetric(minimum_score=0.7)` is an default metric provided by DeepEval for you to evaluate how factually correct your application's output is based on the provided context.
- All metric scores range from 0 - 1, which the `minimum_score=0.7` threshold ultimately determines if your test have passed or not.

:::note
`deepeval`'s default metrics are not evaluated using LLMs. Keep reading this tutorial to learn how to create an LLM based evaluation metric.
:::

To save the test results locally for each test run, set the `DEEPEVAL_RESULTS_FOLDER` environement variable to your relative path of choice:

```console
export DEEPEVAL_RESULTS_FOLDER="./data"
```

## Create Your First Custom Metric

`deepeval` provides two types of custom metric to evaluate LLM outputs: metrics evaluated with LLMs and metrics evaluated without LLMs. Here is a brief overview of each custom metric.

### LLM Evaluated Metrics

An LLM evaluated metric, is one where evaluation is carried out by an LLM. Here's how you can create a custom, LLM evaluated metric.

```python title="test_example.py"
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import LLMEvalMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams

...

def test_summarization():
    input = "What if these shoes don't fit? I want a full refund."

    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
    actual_output = "If the shoes don't fit, the customer wants a full refund."

    summarization_metric = LLMEvalMetric(
        name="Summarization",
        criteria="Summarization - determine if the actual output is an accurate and concise summarization of the input.",
        evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],
        minimum_score=0.5
    )
    test_case = LLMTestCase(input=input, actual_output=actual_output)
    assert_test(test_case, [summarization_metric])
```

### Classic Metrics

A classic metric is a metric where evluation is not carried out by another LLM. You can define a custom classic metric by defining the `measure` and `is_successful` methods upon inheriting the base `Metric` class. Paste in the following:

```python title="test_example.py"
from deepeval.metrics import BaseMetric

...

class LengthMetric(BaseMetric):
    # This metric checks if the output length is greater than 10 characters
    def __init__(self, max_length: int=10):
        self.minimum_score = max_length

    def measure(self, test_case: LLMTestCase):
        self.success = len(test_case.actual_output) > self.minimum_score
        if self.success:
            score = 1
        else:
            score = 0
        return score

    def is_successful(self):
        return self.success

    @property
    def __name__(self):
        return "Length"


def test_length():
    input = "What if these shoes don't fit?"

    # Replace this with the actual output of your LLM application
    actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."
    length_metric = LengthMetric(max_length=10)
    test_case = LLMTestCase(input=input, actual_output=actual_output)
    assert_test(test_case, [length_metric])
```

Run `deepeval test run` from the root directory of your project again:

```console
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

You should see both `test_hallucination` and `test_length` passing.

**Two things to note:**

- Custom metrics does requires a `mimimum_score` as a passing criteria. In the case of our `LengthMetric`, the passing criteria was whether the `max_length` of `actual_output` is greater than 10.
- We removed `context` in `test_length` since it was irrelevant to evaluating output length. All you need is `input` and `actual_output` to create a valid `LLMTestCase`.

## Combine Your Metrics

You might've noticed we have duplicated test cases for both `test_hallucination` and `test_length` (ie. they have the same input and expected output). To avoid this redundancy, `deepeval` offers an easy way to apply as many metrics as you wish on a single test case.

```python title="test_example.py"
...

def test_everything():
    input = "What if these shoes don't fit?"
    context = ["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]

    # Replace this with the actual output of your LLM application
    actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."
    hallucination_metric = HallucinationMetric(minimum_score=0.7)
    length_metric = LengthMetric(max_length=10)
    summarization_metric = LLMEvalMetric(
        name="Summarization",
        criteria="Summarization - determine if the actual output is an accurate and concise summarization of the input.",
        evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],
        minimum_score=0.5
    )

    test_case = LLMTestCase(input=input, actual_output=actual_output, context=context)
    assert_test(test_case, [hallucination_metric, length_metric, summarization_metric])
```

In this scenario, `test_everything` only passes if all metrics are passing. Run `deepeval test run` again to see the results:

```console
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

## Evaluate Your Dataset in Bulk

First, parse your evaluation dataset into the following format:

```python
class DataPoint:
    input: str
    expected_output: Optional[str]
    context: Optional[List[str]]

class Dataset:
   data_points: List[DataPoint]
```

Utilize the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to loop through and evaluate your entire evaluation dataset.

```python title="test_bulk.py"
import pytest
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

dataset = [
    {
        "input": "What are your operating hours?",
        "context": [
            "Our company operates from 10 AM to 6 PM, Monday to Friday.",
            "We are closed on weekends and public holidays.",
            "Our customer service is available 24/7.",
        ],
    },
    {
        "input": "Do you offer free shipping?",
        "expected_output": "Yes, we offer free shipping on orders over $50.",
        "context": [
            "We offer free shipping on all orders over $50.",
        ],
    },
    {
        "input": "What is your return policy?",
        "context": [
            "Free returns within the first 30 days of purchase."
        ],
    },
]


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "test_case",
    dataset,
)
def test_hallucination(test_case: dict):
    input = test_case.get("input")
    expected_output = test_case.get("expected_output")
    context = test_case.get("context")

    # Replace this with the actual output of your LLM application
    actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."

    hallucination_metric = HallucinationMetric(minimum_score=0.7)
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=input,
        actual_output=actual_output,
        expected_output=expected_output,
        context=context
    )
    assert_test(test_case, [hallucination_metric])
```

To run test cases at once in parallel, use the optional `-n` flag followed by a number (that determines the number of processes that will be used) when executing `deepeval test run`:

```
deepeval test run test_bulk.py -n 2
```

...

@deepeval.set_hyperparameters
def hyperparameters():
    return {
        "chunk_size": 500,
        "temperature": 0,
        "model": "GPT-4",
        "prompt_template": """You are a helpful assistant, answer the following question in a non-judgemental tone.

        Question:
        {question}
        """,
    }
```

Execute `deepeval test run test_example.py` again to start comparing hyperparmeters for each test run.
