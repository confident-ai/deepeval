**DeepEval** is an open-source evaluation framework for LLMs. DeepEval makes it extremely easy to build
and iterate on LLM (applications) and was built with the following principles in mind:

- Easily "unit test" LLM outputs in a similar way to Pytest.
- Plug-and-use 30+ LLM-evaluated metrics, most with research backing.
- Supports both end-to-end and component level evaluation.
- Evaluation for RAG, agents, chatbots, and virtually any use case.
- Synthetic dataset generation with state-of-the-art evolution techniques.
- Metrics are simple to customize and covers all use cases.
- Red team, safety scan LLM applications for security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, DeepEval has a cloud platform [Confident AI](https://app.confident-ai.com), which allow teams to use DeepEval to **evaluate, regression test, red team, and monitor** LLM applications on the cloud.

## Setup A Python Environment

Go to the root directory of your project and create a virtual environment (if you don't already have one). In the CLI, run:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Installation

In your newly created virtual environment, run:

```bash.log
pip install -U deepeval
```

`deepeval` runs evaluations locally on your environment. To keep your testing reports in a centralized place on the cloud, use [Confident AI](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs), the native evaluation platform for DeepEval:

```bash
deepeval login
```

:::tip
Confident AI is free and allows you to keep all evaluation results on the cloud. Sign up [here.](https://app.confident-ai.com)
:::

## Create Your First Test Run

Run `touch test_example.py` to create a test file in your root directory to run your first **end-to-end evaluation**. An [LLM test case](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#llm-test-case) in `deepeval` is represents a single unit of LLM app interaction (for a series of LLM interactions i.e. conversation, visit the conversational test cases [section](/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases) instead).

![ok](https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/llm-test-case.svg)

Open `test_example.py` and paste in your first test case:

```python title="test_example.py"
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams
from deepeval.metrics import GEval

def test_correctness():
    correctness_metric = GEval(
        name="Correctness",
        criteria="Determine if the 'actual output' is correct based on the 'expected output'.",
        evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT],
        threshold=0.5
    )
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input="I have a persistent cough and fever. Should I be worried?",
        # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
        actual_output="A persistent cough and fever could be a viral infection or something more serious. See a doctor if symptoms worsen or don't improve in a few days.",
        expected_output="A persistent cough and fever could indicate a range of illnesses, from a mild viral infection to more serious conditions like pneumonia or COVID-19. You should seek medical attention if your symptoms worsen, persist for more than a few days, or are accompanied by difficulty breathing, chest pain, or other concerning signs."
    )
    assert_test(test_case, [correctness_metric])
```

Run `deepeval test run` from the root directory of your project to evaluate your LLM app **end-to-end**:

```bash
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

**Congratulations! Your test case should have passed ✅** Let's breakdown what happened.

- The variable `input` mimics a user input, and `actual_output` is a placeholder for what your application's supposed to output based on this input.
- The variable `expected_output` represents the ideal answer for a given `input`, and [`GEval`](/docs/metrics-llm-evals) is a research-backed metric provided by `deepeval` for you to evaluate your LLM output's on any custom metric with human-like accuracy.
- In this example, the metric `criteria` is correctness of the `actual_output` based on the provided `expected_output`, but not all metrics require an `expected_output`.
- All metric scores range from 0 - 1, which the `threshold=0.5` threshold ultimately determines if your test have passed or not.

If you run more than one test run, you will be able to **catch regressions** by comparing test cases side-by-side. This is also made easier if you're using `deepeval` alongside Confident AI ([see below](/docs/getting-started#save-results-on-confident-ai-highly-recommended) for video demo).

:::info
You'll need to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable before running `GEval`, since `GEval` is an LLM-evaluated metric. To use **ANY** custom LLM of your choice, [check out this part of the docs](/guides/guides-using-custom-llms).
:::

### Save Results

It is recommended that you manage your evaluation suite on Confident AI, the `deepeval` platform.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="confident-ai" label="Confident AI">

It is **highly recommended** to save results on Confident AI, the `deepeval` cloud, to make your evaluation life easier. Run `deepeval login` (or [click here](https://app.confident-ai.com)) in the CLI to get your API key.

```bash
deepeval login
```

Or, you can also run `deepeval view`

```bash
deepeval view
```

After you've pasted in your API key, Confident AI will **generate testing reports and automate regression testing** whenever you run a test run to evaluate your LLM application inside any environment, at any scale, anywhere.

<VideoDisplayer
  src="https://confident-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/evaluation:overview.mp4"
  confidentUrl="/docs/getting-started/setup"
  label="Watch Full Guide on Confident AI"
/>

**Once you've ran more than one test run**, you'll be able to use the [regression testing page](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs/llm-evaluation/ab-regression-testing) shown near the end of the video. Green rows indicate that your LLM has shown improvement on specific test cases, whereas red rows highlight areas of regression.

You should save your test run as a dataset on Confident AI, which allows you to **reuse and edit** the set of `input`s and any `expected_output`, `context`, etc. for subsequent evaluations.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Locally" label="Locally in JSON">

Simply set the `DEEPEVAL_RESULTS_FOLDER` environment variable to your relative path of choice.

```bash
# linux
export DEEPEVAL_RESULTS_FOLDER="./data"

# or windows
set DEEPEVAL_RESULTS_FOLDER=.\data
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Evaluate Nested Components

:::note
What we saw above is known as **end-to-end** evaluation, which treats your LLM app as a black-box. If you wish to evaluate multiple components in your LLM app, you can implement **component-level** evals instead.
:::

Simply trace "components" such as LLM calls, retrievers, tool calls, and agents within your LLM application using the `@observe` decorator to apply metrics on a component-level. Tracing with `deepeval` is non-instrusive (learn more [here](/docs/evaluation-llm-tracing)) and helps you avoid rewriting your codebase just for evals:

```python
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_span
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import Golden
from deepeval.metrics import GEval
from deepeval import evaluate

correctness = GEval(name="Correctness", criteria="Determine if the 'actual output' is correct based on the 'expected output'.", evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT])

@observe(metrics=[correctness])
def inner_component():
    # Component can be anything from an LLM call, retrieval, agent, tool use, etc.
    update_current_span(test_case=LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="..."))
    return

@observe
def llm_app(input: str):
    inner_component()
    return

evaluate(observed_callback=llm_app, goldens=[Golden(input="Hi!")])
```

**Tracing also helps you debug evaluations** when using Confident AI (video below). You can learn everything about component-level evaluations [here.](/docs/evaluation-component-level-llm-evals)

<VideoDisplayer
  src="https://confident-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/observability:llm-tracing.mp4"
  confidentUrl="/docs/llm-tracing/introduction"
  label="LLM Tracing on Confident AI"
/>

## Create Your First Metric

`deepeval` provides two types of LLM evaluation metrics to evaluate LLM outputs: plug-and-use **default** metrics, and **custom** metrics for any evaluation criteria.

:::info
You can use metrics the same way for both end-to-end and component-level evaluations.
:::

### Default Metrics

`deepeval` offers 30+ research backed default metrics covering a wide range of use-cases. Here are a few popular metrics:

- RAG:
  - Answer Relevancy
  - Faithfulness
  - Contextual Relevancy
  - Contextual Recall
  - Contextual Precision
- Agents:
  - Tool Correctness
  - Task Completion
- Chatbots:
  - Conversation Completeness
  - Conversation Relevancy
  - Role Adherence

To create a metric, simply import from the `deepeval.metrics` module:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")
relevancy = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)

relevancy.measure(test_case)
print(relevancy.score, relevancy.reason)
```

Note that you can run a metric as a standalone or as part of a test run as shown in previous sections.

:::info
All default metrics are evaluated using LLMs, and you can use **ANY** LLM of your choice. For more information, visit the [metrics introduction section.](/docs/metrics-introduction)
:::

### Custom Metrics

`deepeval` provides G-Eval, a state-of-the-art LLM evaluation framework for anyone to create a custom LLM-evaluated metric using natural language. Here's an example:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams
from deepeval.metrics import GEval

test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...", expected_output="...")
correctness = GEval(
    name="Correctness",
    criteria="Correctness - determine if the actual output is correct according to the expected output.",
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT],
    strict_mode=True
)

correctness.measure(test_case)
print(correctness.score, correctness.reason)
```

Under the hood, `deepeval` first generates a series of evaluation steps, before using these steps in conjunction with information in an `LLMTestCase` for evaluation. For more information, visit the [G-Eval documentation page.](/docs/metrics-llm-evals)

### (Super) Custom Metrics

Although `GEval` is great in many ways as a custom, task-specific metric, it is **NOT** deterministic. If you're looking for more fine-grained, deterministic control over your metric scores, you should be using the [`DAGMetric` (deep acyclic graph)](/docs/metrics-dag) instead, which is **a metric that is deterministic, LLM-powered, and based on a decision tree you define.**

Take this decision tree for example, which evaluates a Summarization use case based on the `actual_output` of your `LLMTestCase`. Here, we want to check whether the `actual_output` contains the correct "summary headings", and whether they are in the correct order.

<details><summary>Click to see code associated with diagram below</summary>

```python
from deepeval.metrics.dag import (
    DeepAcyclicGraph,
    TaskNode,
    BinaryJudgementNode,
    NonBinaryJudgementNode,
    VerdictNode,
)
from deepeval.metrics import DAGMetric

correct_order_node = NonBinaryJudgementNode(
    criteria="Are the summary headings in the correct order: 'intro' => 'body' => 'conclusion'?",
    children=[
        VerdictNode(verdict="Yes", score=10),
        VerdictNode(verdict="Two are out of order", score=4),
        VerdictNode(verdict="All out of order", score=2),
    ],
)

correct_headings_node = BinaryJudgementNode(
    criteria="Does the summary headings contain all three: 'intro', 'body', and 'conclusion'?",
    children=[
        VerdictNode(verdict=False, score=0),
        VerdictNode(verdict=True, child=correct_order_node)
    ],
)

extract_headings_node = TaskNode(
    instructions="Extract all headings in `actual_output`",
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],
    output_label="Summary headings",
    children=[correct_headings_node, correct_order_node],
)

# Initialize the DAG
dag = DeepAcyclicGraph(root_nodes=[extract_headings_node])

# Create metric!
metric = DAGMetric(name="Summarization", dag=dag)
```

</details>

  <img
    style={{ width: "75%" }}
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/metrics:dag:summarization.png"
  />
</div>

For more information, visit the [`DAGMetric` documentation.](/docs/metrics-dag)

## Measure Multiple Metrics At Once

To avoid redundant code, `deepeval` offers an easy way to apply as many metrics as you wish for a single test case.

```python title="test_example.py"
...

def test_everything():
    assert_test(test_case, [correctness_metric, answer_relevancy_metric])
```

In this scenario, `test_everything` only passes if all metrics are passing. Run `deepeval test run` again to see the results:

```bash
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

:::info
`deepeval` optimizes evaluation speed by running all metrics for each test case concurrently.
:::

## Create Your First Dataset

A dataset in `deepeval`, or more specifically an evaluation dataset, is simply a collection of `LLMTestCases` and/or `Goldens`.

:::note
A `Golden` is simply an `LLMTestCase` with no `actual_output`, and it is an important concept if you're looking to generate LLM outputs at evaluation time. To learn more about `Golden`s, [click here.](/docs/evaluation-datasets#with-goldens)
:::

To create a dataset, simply initialize an `EvaluationDataset` with a list of `LLMTestCase`s or `Golden`s:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

dataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")])
```

Then, using `deepeval`'s Pytest integration, you can utilize the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to loop through and evaluate your dataset.

```python title="test_dataset.py"
import pytest
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
...

# Loop through test cases using Pytest
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "test_case",
    dataset,
)
def test_customer_chatbot(test_case: LLMTestCase):
    assert_test(test_case, [AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)])
```

You can also evaluate entire datasets without going through the CLI (if you're in a notebook environment):

```python
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval import evaluate
...

evaluate(dataset, [AnswerRelevancyMetric()])
```

Additionally you can run test cases in parallel by using the optional `-n` flag followed by a number (that determines the number of processes that will be used) when executing `deepeval test run`:

```
deepeval test run test_dataset.py -n 2
```

:::tip

Visit the [evaluation introduction section](/docs/evaluation-flags-and-configs#flags-for-deepeval-test-run) to learn about the different types of flags you can use with the `deepeval test run` command.
:::

Especially for those working as part of a team, or have domain experts annotating datasets for you, it is best practice to keep your dataset somewhere as one source of truth. Your team can annotate datasets directly on [Confident AI](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs/dataset-editor/annotate-datasets), which is also 100% integrated with `deepeval`:

<VideoDisplayer
  src="https://confident-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dataset-editor:dataset-annotation.mp4"
  confidentUrl="/docs/dataset-editor/annotate-datasets"
  label="Learn Dataset Annotation on Confident AI"
/>

You can then pull the dataset from the cloud to evaluate locally like how you would pull a Github repo.

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
# supply your dataset alias
dataset.pull(alias="QA Dataset")

evaluate(dataset, metrics=[AnswerRelevancyMetric()])
```

And you're done! All results will also be available on Confident AI available for comparison and analysis.

## Generate Synthetic Datasets

`deepeval` offers a synthetic data generator that uses state-of-the-art evolution techniques to make synthetic (aka. AI generated) datasets realistic. This is especially helpful if you don't have a prepared evaluation dataset, as it will **help you generate the initiate testing data you need** to get up and running with evaluation.

:::caution
You should aim to manually inspect and edit any synthetic data where possible.
:::

Simply supply a list of local document paths to generate a synthetic dataset from your knowledge base.

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
goldens = synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_docs(
  document_paths=['example.txt', 'example.docx', 'example.pdf']
)

dataset = EvaluationDataset(goldens=goldens)
```

After you're done with generating, simply evaluate your dataset as shown above. Note that `deepeval`'s `Synthesizer` does **NOT** generate `actual_output`s for each golden. This is because `actual_output`s are meant to be generated by your LLM (application), not `deepeval`'s synthesizer.

[Visit the synthesizer section](/docs/synthesizer-introduction) to learn how to customize `deepeval`'s synthetic data generation capabilities to your needs.

:::note
Remember, a `Golden` is basically an `LLMTestCase` but with no `actual_output`.
:::

## Red Team Your LLM application

LLM red teaming refers to the process of attacking your LLM application to expose any safety risks it may have, including but not limited to vulnerabilities such as bias, racism, encouraging illegal actions, etc. It is an automated way to test for LLM safety by prompting it with adversarial attacks.

:::danger
**IMPORTANT:** Since March 16th 2025, to provide a better red teaming experience for everyone, all of `deepeval`'s red teaming functionalities has been migrated to a separate called **DeepTeam** that is dedicated for red teaming. To install, run:

```python
pip install -U deepteam
```

DeepTeam is built on top of DeepEval and follows the same design principles, with the same customizations that you would expect in DeepEval's ecosystem. **Use DeepTeam alongside DeepEval** if you wish to do both regular LLM evaluation and LLM safety testing.

Here is [DeepTeam's quickstart.](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/getting-started)
:::

Red teaming is a different form of testing from what you've seen above because while standard LLM evaluation tests your LLM on its **intended functionality**, red teaming is meant to test your LLM application against, intentional, adversarial attacks from malicious users.

Here's how you can **scan your LLM for vulnerabilities in a few lines of code** using [DeepTeam](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/getting-started), an extremely powerful package to automatically scan for [50+ vulnerabilities](red-teaming-vulnerabilities):

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import PromptInjection

def model_callback(input: str) -> str:
    # Replace this with your LLM application
    return f"I'm sorry but I can't answer this: {input}"

bias = Bias(types=["race"])
prompt_injection = PromptInjection()

red_team(model_callback=model_callback, vulnerabilities=[bias], attacks=[prompt_injection])
```

`deepteam` is highly customizable and offers a range of different advanced red teaming capabilities for anyone to leverage. We highly recommend you read more about the `deepteam` in this [documentation.](/docs/red-teaming-introduction)

And that's it! You now know how to not only test your LLM application for its functionality, but also for any underlying risks and vulnerabilities it may expose and make your systems susceptible to malicious attacks.

For more in-depth red teaming, go to [DeepTeam's documentation.](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/getting-started)

## Using Confident AI

[Confident AI](https://confident-ai.com) is the `deepeval` cloud platform. While `deepeval` runs locally and all testing data are lost afterwards, Confident AI offers data persistence, regression testing, sharable testing reports, monitoring, collecting human feedback, and so much more.

:::note
On-prem hosting is also available. [Book a demo](https://confident-ai.com/book-a-demo) to learn more about it.
:::

Here is the **LLM development workflow** that is highly recommended with Confident AI:

- Curate datasets
- Run evaluations with dataset
- Analyze evaluation results
- Improve LLM application based on evaluation results
- Run another evaluation on the same dataset

And once your LLM application is live in **production**, you should:

- Monitor LLM outputs, and enable online metrics to flag unsatisfactory outputs
- Review unsatisfactory outputs, and decide whether to add it to your evaluation dataset

While there are many LLMOps platform that exist, Confident AI is laser focused on evaluations, although we also offer advanced observability, and native to `deepeval`, meaning users of `deepeval` requires no additional code to use Confident AI.

:::caution
This section is just an overview of Confident AI. If Confident AI sounds interesting, [**click here**](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs) for the full Confident AI quickstart guide instead.
:::

### Login

Confident AI integrates 100% with `deepeval`. All you need to do is [create an account here](https://app.confident-ai.com), or run the following command to login:

```bash
deepeval login
```

This will open your web browser where you can follow the instructions displayed on the CLI to create an account, get your Confident API key, and paste it in the CLI. You should see a message congratulating your successful login.

:::tip

You can also login directly in Python once you have your API key:

```python title="main.py"
deepeval.login_with_confident_api_key("your-confident-api-key")
```

:::

### Curating Datasets

By keeping your datasets on Confident AI, you can ensure that your datasets that are used to run evaluations are always in-sync with your codebase. This is especially helpful if your datasets are edited by someone else, such as a domain expert.

<video width="100%" controls muted playsInline>
  <source
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/confident-create-dataset.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

Once you have your dataset on Confident AI, access it by pulling it from the cloud:

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.pull(alias="My first dataset")
print(dataset)
```

You'll often times want to process the pulled dataset before evaluating it, since test cases in a dataset are stored as `Golden`s, which might not always be ready for evaluation (ie. missing an `actual_output`). To see a concrete example and a more detailed explanation, visit the [evaluating datasets section.](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs)

### Running Evaluations

You can either run evaluations [locally using `deepeval`](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs), or on the cloud on a [collection of metrics](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs) (which is also powered by `deepeval`). Most of the time, running evaluations locally is preferred because it allows for greater flexibility in metric customization. Using the previously pulled dataset, we can run an evaluation:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
...

evaluate(dataset, metrics=[AnswerRelevancyMetric()])
```

You'll get a sharable testing report generated for you on Confident AI once your evaluation has completed. If you have more than two testing reports, you can also compare them to catch any regressions.

<video width="100%" controls muted playsInline>
  <source
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/confident-full-test-run.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

:::info
You can also log hyperparameters via the `evaluate()` function:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
...

evaluate(
    test_cases=[...],
    metrics=[...],
    hyperparameters={"model": "gpt-4.1", "prompt template": "..."}
)
```

Feel free to execute this in a nested for loop to figure out which combination gives the best results.

:::

### Monitoring LLM Outputs

Confident AI allows anyone to [monitor, trace, and evaluate LLM outputs in real-time.](https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs) A single API request is all that's required, and this would typically happen at your servers right before returning an LLM response to your users:

```python
import openai
import deepeval

client = OpenAI()

def sync_without_stream(user_message: str):
    model = "gpt-4-turbo"
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model=model,
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_message}]
    )
    output = response.choices[0].message.content

    # Run monitor() synchronously
    deepeval.monitor(input=user_message, output=output, model=model, event_name="RAG chatbot")
    return output

print(sync_without_stream("Tell me a joke."))
```

<video width="100%" controls muted playsInline>
  <source
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/confident-simple-monitoring.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

### Collecting Human Feedback

Confident AI allows you to send human feedback on LLM responses monitored in production, all via one API call by using the previously returned `response_id` from `deepeval.monitor()`:

```python
import deepeval
...

deepeval.send_feedback(
    response_id=response_id,
    provider="user",
    rating=7,
    explanation="Although the response is accurate, I think the spacing makes it hard to read."
)
```

Confident AI allows you to keep track of either `"user"` feedback (ie. feedback provided by end users interacting with your LLM application), or `"reviewer"` feedback (ie. feedback provided by reviewers manually checking the quality of LLM responses in production).

:::note
