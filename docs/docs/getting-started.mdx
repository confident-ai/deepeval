**DeepEval** is an open-source evaluation framework for LLMs. DeepEval makes it extremely easy to build
and iterate on LLM (applications) and was built with the following principles in mind:

- Easily "unit test" LLM outputs in a similar way to Pytest.
- Plug-and-use 30+ LLM-evaluated metrics, most with research backing.
- Supports both end-to-end and component level evaluation.
- Evaluation for RAG, agents, chatbots, and virtually any use case.
- Synthetic dataset generation with state-of-the-art evolution techniques.
- Metrics are simple to customize and covers all use cases.
- Red team, safety scan LLM applications for security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, DeepEval has a cloud platform [Confident AI](https://app.confident-ai.com), which allow teams to use DeepEval to **evaluate, regression test, red team, and monitor** LLM applications on the cloud.

## Installation

In a newly created virtual environment, run:

```bash
pip install -U deepeval
```

`deepeval` runs evaluations locally on your environment. To keep your testing reports in a centralized place on the cloud, use [Confident AI](https://www.confident-ai.com), the native evaluation platform for DeepEval:

```bash
deepeval login
```

<details>

<summary>Configure Environment Variables</summary>

DeepEval autoloads environment files (at import time)

- **Precedence:** existing process env -> `.env.local` -> `.env`
- **Opt-out:** set `DEEPEVAL_DISABLE_DOTENV=1`

More information on `env` settings can be [found here.](/docs/evaluation-flags-and-configs#environment-flags)

```bash
# quickstart
cp .env.example .env.local
# then edit .env.local (ignored by git)
```

</details>

:::note
Confident AI is free and allows you to keep all evaluation results on the cloud. Sign up [here.](https://app.confident-ai.com)

## Create Your First Test Run

Create a test file to run your first **end-to-end evaluation**.

<Tabs groupId="single-multi-turns">

<TabItem value="single-turn" label="Single-Turn">

An [LLM test case](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#llm-test-case) in `deepeval` represents a **single unit of LLM app interaction**, and contains mandatory fields such as the `input` and `actual_output` (LLM generated output), and optional ones like `expected_output`.

![LLM Test Case](https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/docs:llm-test-case.png)

Run `touch test_example.py` in your terminal and paste in the following code:

```python title="test_example.py"
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams
from deepeval.metrics import GEval

def test_correctness():
    correctness_metric = GEval(
        name="Correctness",
        criteria="Determine if the 'actual output' is correct based on the 'expected output'.",
        evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT],
        threshold=0.5
    )
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input="I have a persistent cough and fever. Should I be worried?",
        # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
        actual_output="A persistent cough and fever could be a viral infection or something more serious. See a doctor if symptoms worsen or don't improve in a few days.",
        expected_output="A persistent cough and fever could indicate a range of illnesses, from a mild viral infection to more serious conditions like pneumonia or COVID-19. You should seek medical attention if your symptoms worsen, persist for more than a few days, or are accompanied by difficulty breathing, chest pain, or other concerning signs."
    )
    assert_test(test_case, [correctness_metric])
```

Then, run `deepeval test run` from the root directory of your project to evaluate your LLM app **end-to-end**:

```bash
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

Congratulations! Your test case should have passed ✅ Let's breakdown what happened.

- The variable `input` mimics a user input, and `actual_output` is a placeholder for what your application's supposed to output based on this input.
- The variable `expected_output` represents the ideal answer for a given `input`, and [`GEval`](/docs/metrics-llm-evals) is a research-backed metric provided by `deepeval` for you to evaluate your LLM output's on any custom metric with human-like accuracy.
- In this example, the metric `criteria` is correctness of the `actual_output` based on the provided `expected_output`, but not all metrics require an `expected_output`.
- All metric scores range from 0 - 1, which the `threshold=0.5` threshold ultimately determines if your test have passed or not.

If you run more than one test run, you will be able to **catch regressions** by comparing test cases side-by-side. This is also made easier if you're using `deepeval` alongside Confident AI ([see below](/docs/getting-started#save-results-on-cloud) for video demo).

  </TabItem>

<TabItem value="multi-turn" label="Multi-Turn">

A [conversational test case](/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases#conversational-test-case) in `deepeval` represents a **multi-turn interaction with your LLM app**, and contains information such as the actual conversation that took place in the format of `turn`s, and optionally the scenario of which a conversation happened.

![Conversational Test Case](https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/docs:conversational-test-case.png)

Run `touch test_example.py` in your terminal and paste in the following code:

```python title="test_example.py"
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import ConversationalGEval

def test_professionalism():
    professionalism_metric = ConversationalGEval(
        name="Professionalism",
        criteria="Determine whether the assistant has acted professionally based on the content.",
        threshold=0.5
    )
    test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
        turns=[
            Turn(role="user", content="What is DeepEval?"),
            Turn(role="assistant", content="DeepEval is an open-source LLM eval package.")
        ]
    )
    assert_test(test_case, [professionalism_metric])
```

Then, run `deepeval test run` from the root directory of your project to evaluate your LLM app **end-to-end**:

```bash
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

🎉 Congratulations! Your test case should have passed ✅ Let's breakdown what happened.

- The variable `role` distinguishes between the end user and your LLM application, and `content` contains either the user’s input or the LLM’s output.
- In this example, the `criteria` metric evaluates the professionalism of the sequence of `content`.
- All metric scores range from 0 - 1, which the `threshold=0.5` threshold ultimately determines if your test have passed or not.

If you run more than one test run, you will be able to **catch regressions** by comparing test cases side-by-side. This is also made easier if you're using `deepeval` alongside Confident AI ([see below](/docs/getting-started#save-results-on-cloud) for video demo).

:::info

Since almost all `deepeval` metrics including `GEval` are LLM-as-a-Judge metrics, you'll need to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an env variable. You can also customize the model used for evals:

```python
correctness_metric = GEval(..., model="o1")
```

DeepEval also integrates with these model providers: [Ollama](https://deepeval.com/integrations/models/ollama), [Azure OpenAI](https://deepeval.com/integrations/models/azure-openai), [Anthropic](https://deepeval.com/integrations/models/anthropic), [Gemini](https://deepeval.com/integrations/models/gemini), etc. To use **ANY** custom LLM of your choice, [check out this part of the
docs](/guides/guides-using-custom-llms).

<details>

<summary>Evaluations getting "stuck"?</summary>

Most likely your evaluation LLM is failing and this might be due to rate limits or insufficient quotas. By default, `deepeval` retries **transient** LLM errors once (2 attempts total):

- **Retried:** network/timeout errors and **5xx** server errors.
- **Rate limits (429):** retried unless the provider marks them non-retryable
  (for OpenAI, `insufficient_quota` is treated as non-retryable).
- **Backoff:** exponential with jitter (initial **1s**, base **2**, jitter **2s**, cap **5s**).

You can tune these via environment flags (no code changes). See [Environment Flags](./evaluation-flags-and-configs#environment-flags) for details.

### Save Results

It is recommended that you manage your evaluation suite on Confident AI, the `deepeval` platform.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="confident-ai" label="Confident AI">

Confident AI is the `deepeval` cloud, and helps you build the best LLM evals pipeline. Run `deepeval view` to view your newly ran test run on the platform:

```bash
deepeval view
```

The `deepeval view` command requires that the test run that you ran above has been successfully cached locally. If something errors, simply run a new test run after logging in with `deepeval login`:

```bash
deepeval login
```

After you've pasted in your API key, Confident AI will **generate testing reports and automate regression testing** whenever you run a test run to evaluate your LLM application inside any environment, at any scale, anywhere.

<VideoDisplayer
  src="https://confident-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/evaluation:overview.mp4"
  confidentUrl="/docs/getting-started/setup"
  label="Watch Full Guide on Confident AI"
/>

**Once you've ran more than one test run**, you'll be able to use the [regression testing page](https://www.confident-ai.com/docs/llm-evaluation/dashboards/ab-regression-testing) shown near the end of the video. Green rows indicate that your LLM has shown improvement on specific test cases, whereas red rows highlight areas of regression.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Locally" label="Locally in JSON">

Simply set the `DEEPEVAL_RESULTS_FOLDER` environment variable to your relative path of choice.

```bash
# linux
export DEEPEVAL_RESULTS_FOLDER="./data"

# or windows
set DEEPEVAL_RESULTS_FOLDER=.\data
```

</TabItem>

## Test Runs With LLM Tracing

While end-to-end evals treat your LLM app as a black-box, you also evaluate **individual components** within your LLM app through **LLM tracing**. This is the recommended way to evaluate AI agents.

![component level evals](https://deepeval-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/component-level-evals.png)

First paste in the following code:

```python title="main.py"
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_span
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset, Golden
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

# 1. Decorate your app
@observe()
def llm_app(input: str):
  # 2. Decorate components with metrics you wish to evaluate or debug
  @observe(metrics=[AnswerRelevancyMetric()])
  def inner_component():
      # 3. Create test case at runtime
      update_current_span(test_case=LLMTestCase(input="Why is the blue sky?", actual_output="You mean why is the sky blue?"))

  return inner_component()

# 4. Create dataset
dataset = EvaluationDataset(goldens=[Golden(input="Test input")])

# 5. Loop through dataset
for golden in dataset.evals_iterator():
  # 6. Call LLM app
  llm_app(golden.input)
```

Then run `python main.py` to run a **component-level** eval:

```bash
python main.py
```

🎉 Congratulations! Your test case should have passed again ✅ Let's breakdown what happened.

- The `@observe` decorate tells `deepeval` where each component is and **creates an LLM trace** at execution time
- Any `metrics` supplied to `@observe` allows `deepeval` to evaluate that component based on the `LLMTestCase` you create
- In this example `AnswerRelevancyMetric()` was used to evaluate `inner_component()`
- The `dataset` specifies the **goldens** which will be used to invoke your `llm_app` during evaluation, which happens in a simple for loop

Once the for loop has ended, `deepeval` will aggregate all metrics, test cases in each component, and run evals across them all, before generating the final testing report.

:::info

When you do LLM tracing using `deepeval`, you can automatically evals on **traces, spans, and threads (conversations) in production**. Simply get an [API key from Confident AI](https://app.confident-ai.com) and set it in the CLI:

```bash
CONFIDENT_API_KEY="confident_us..."
```

`deepeval`'s LLM tracing implementation is **non-instrusive**, meaning it will not affect any part of your code.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="traces" label="Trace (end-to-end) Evals in Prod">

Evals on traces are [end-to-end evaluations](/docs/evaluation-end-to-end-llm-evals), where a single LLM interaction is being evaluated.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="spans" label="Span (component-level) Evals in Prod">

Spans make up a trace and evals on spans represents [component-level evaluations](/docs/evaluation-component-level-llm-evals), where individual components in your LLM app are being evaluated.
