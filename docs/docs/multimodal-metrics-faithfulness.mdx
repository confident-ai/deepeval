import Equation from "@site/src/components/Equation";

The multimodal faithfulness metric measures the quality of your RAG pipeline's generator by evaluating whether the `actual_output` factually aligns with the contents of your `retrieval_context`. `deepeval`'s multimodal faithfulness metric is a self-explaining MLLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

:::info
The **Multimodal Faithfulness** is the multimodal adaptation of DeepEval's [faithfulness metric](/docs/metrics-faithfulness). It accepts images in addition to text for the `input`, `actual_output`, and `retrieval_context`.
:::

## Required Arguments

To use the `MultimodalFaithfulnessMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`MLLMTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#mllm-test-case):

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `retrieval_context`

The `input` and `actual_output` are required to create an `MLLMTestCase` (and hence required by all metrics) even though they might not be used for metric calculation. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import MultimodalFaithfulnessMetric
from deepeval.test_case import MLLMTestCase, MLLMImage

metric = MultimodalFaithfulnessMetric()
test_case = MLLMTestCase(
    input=["Tell me about some landmarks in France"],
    actual_output=[
        "France is home to iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower in Paris.",
        MLLMImage(...)
    ],
    retrieval_context=[
        MLLMImage(...),
        "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower built in the late 19th century.",
        MLLMImage(...)
    ]
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)

# or evaluate test cases in bulk
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

There are **SEVEN** optional parameters when creating a `MultimodalFaithfulnessMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's Multimodal GPT models to use, **OR** any custom MLLM model of type `DeepEvalBaseMLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `truths_extraction_limit`: an int which when set, determines the maximum number of factual truths to extract from the `retrieval_context`. The truths extracted will used to determine the degree of factual alignment, and will be ordered by importance, decided by your evaluation `model`. Defaulted to `None`.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `MultimodalFaithfulnessMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Multimodal Faithfulness} = \frac{\text{Number of Truthful Claims}}{\text{Total Number of Claims}}" />

The `MultimodalFaithfulnessMetric` first uses an MLLM to extract all claims made in the `actual_output` (including from images), before using the same MLLM to classify whether each claim is truthful based on the facts presented in the `retrieval_context`.

**A claim is considered truthful if it does not contradict any facts** presented in the `retrieval_context`.

:::note
Sometimes, you may want to only consider the most important factual truths in the `retrieval_context`. If this is the case, you can choose to set the `truths_extraction_limit` parameter to limit the maximum number of truths to consider during evaluation.
