If you already have prepared contexts, you can skip document processing. Simply provide these contexts to `deepeval`'s `Synthesizer`, and it will generate goldens directly without processing documents.

    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}

  />

This is especially helpful if you **already have an embedded knowledge base**. For example, if you have documents parsed and stored in a vector database, you may handle retrieving text chunks yourself.

## Generate Your Goldens

To generate synthetic single or multi-turn goldens from documents, simply provide a list of contexts:

<Tabs groupId="single-multi-turns">

<TabItem value="single-turn" label="Single-Turn">

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
goldens = synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_contexts(
    # Provide a list of context for synthetic data generation
    contexts=[
        ["The Earth revolves around the Sun.", "Planets are celestial bodies."],
        ["Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.", "The chemical formula for water is H2O."],
    ]
)
```

There are **ONE** mandatory and **THREE** optional parameters when using the `generate_goldens_from_contexts` method:

- `contexts`: a list of context, where each context is itself a list of strings, ideally sharing a common theme or subject area.
- [Optional] `include_expected_output`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will additionally generate an `expected_output` for each synthetic `Golden`. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `max_goldens_per_context`: the maximum number of goldens to be generated per context. Defaulted to 2.
- [Optional] `source_files`: a list of strings specifying the source of the contexts. Length of `source_files` **MUST** be the same as the length of `contexts`.

:::info DID YOU KNOW?
The `generate_goldens_from_docs()` method calls the `generate_goldens_from_contexts()` method under the hood, and the only difference between the two is the `generate_goldens_from_contexts()` method does not contain a [context construction step](synthesizer-generate-from-docs#how-does-context-construction-work), but instead uses the provided contexts directly for generation.

Remember, single-turn generations produces single-turn `Golden`s, while multi-turn generations produces multi-turn `ConversationalGolden`s. To learn more about goldens, [click here.](/docs/evaluation-datasets#what-are-goldens)
