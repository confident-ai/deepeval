The contextual precision metric uses LLM-as-a-judge to measure your RAG pipeline's retriever by evaluating whether nodes in your `retrieval_context` that are relevant to the given `input` are ranked higher than irrelevant ones. `deepeval`'s contextual precision metric is a self-explaining LLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

:::info

The `ContextualPrecisionMetric` focuses on evaluating the re-ranker of your RAG pipeline's retriever by assessing the ranking order of the text chunks in the `retrieval_context`.

:::

## Required Arguments

To use the `ContextualPrecisionMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an [`LLMTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#llm-test-case):

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `expected_output`
- `retrieval_context`

The `input` and `actual_output` are required to create an `LLMTestCase` (and hence required by all metrics) even though they might not be used for metric calculation. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

The `ContextualPrecisionMetric()` can be used for [end-to-end](/docs/evaluation-end-to-end-llm-evals) evaluation:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import ContextualPrecisionMetric

# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."

# Replace this with the expected output of your RAG generator
expected_output = "You are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."

# Replace this with the actual retrieved context from your RAG pipeline
retrieval_context = ["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]

metric = ContextualPrecisionMetric(
    threshold=0.7,
    model="gpt-4",
    include_reason=True
)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    actual_output=actual_output,
    expected_output=expected_output,
    retrieval_context=retrieval_context
)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **SEVEN** optional parameters when creating a `ContextualPrecisionMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4.1'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `evaluation_template`: a class of type `ContextualPrecisionTemplate`, which allows you to [override the default prompts](#customize-your-template) used to compute the `ContextualPrecisionMetric` score. Defaulted to `deepeval`'s `ContextualPrecisionTemplate`.

### Within components

You can also run the `ContextualPrecisionMetric` within nested components for [component-level](/docs/evaluation-component-level-llm-evals) evaluation.

```python
from deepeval.dataset import Golden
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_span
...

@observe(metrics=[metric])
def inner_component():
    # Set test case at runtime
    test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")
    update_current_span(test_case=test_case)
    return

@observe
def llm_app(input: str):
    # Component can be anything from an LLM call, retrieval, agent, tool use, etc.
    inner_component()
    return

evaluate(observed_callback=llm_app, goldens=[Golden(input="Hi!")])
```

### As a standalone

You can also run the `ContextualPrecisionMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `ContextualPrecisionMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Contextual Precision} = \frac{1}{\text{Number of Relevant Nodes}} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Nodes Up to Position } k}{k} \times r_{k} \right)" />

:::info

- **_k_** is the (i+1)<sup>th</sup> node in the `retrieval_context`
- **_n_** is the length of the `retrieval_context`
- **_r<sub>k</sub>_** is the binary relevance for the k<sup>th</sup> node in the `retrieval_context`. _r<sub>k</sub>_ = 1 for nodes that are relevant, 0 if not.

:::

The `ContextualPrecisionMetric` first uses an LLM to determine for each node in the `retrieval_context` whether it is relevant to the `input` based on information in the `expected_output`, before calculating the **weighted cumulative precision** as the contextual precision score. The weighted cumulative precision (WCP) is used because it:

- **Emphasizes on Top Results**: WCP places a stronger emphasis on the relevance of top-ranked results. This emphasis is important because LLMs tend to give more attention to earlier nodes in the `retrieval_context` (which may cause downstream hallucination if nodes are ranked incorrectly).
- **Rewards Relevant Ordering**: WCP can handle varying degrees of relevance (e.g., "highly relevant", "somewhat relevant", "not relevant"). This is in contrast to metrics like precision, which treats all retrieved nodes as equally important.

A higher contextual precision score represents a greater ability of the retrieval system to correctly rank relevant nodes higher in the `retrieval_context`.

## Customize Your Template

Since `deepeval`'s `ContextualPrecisionMetric` is evaluated by LLM-as-a-judge, you can likely improve your metric accuracy by [overriding `deepeval`'s default prompt templates](/docs/metrics-introduction#customizing-metric-prompts). This is especially helpful if:

- You're using a [custom evaluation LLM](/guides/guides-using-custom-llms), especially for smaller models that have weaker instruction following capabilities.
- You want to customize the examples used in the default `ContextualPrecisionTemplate` to better align with your expectations.

:::tip
You can learn what the default `ContextualPrecisionTemplate` looks like [here on GitHub](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/blob/main/deepeval/metrics/contextual_precision/template.py), and should read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section above to understand how you can tailor it to your needs.
:::

Here's a quick example of how you can override the statement generation step of the `ContextualPrecisionMetric` algorithm:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import ContextualPrecisionTemplate
from deepeval.metrics.contextual_precision import ContextualPrecisionTemplate

# Define custom template
class CustomTemplate(ContextualPrecisionTemplate):
    @staticmethod
    def generate_verdicts(
        input: str, expected_output: str, retrieval_context: List[str]
    ):
        return f"""Given the input, expected output, and retrieval context, please generate a list of JSON objects to determine whether each node in the retrieval context was remotely useful in arriving at the expected output.

Example JSON:
{{
    "verdicts": [
        {{
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "..."
        }}
    ]
}}
The number of 'verdicts' SHOULD BE STRICTLY EQUAL to that of the contexts.
**

Input:
{input}

Expected output:
{expected_output}

Retrieval Context:
{retrieval_context}

JSON:
"""

# Inject custom template to metric
metric = ContextualPrecisionMetric(evaluation_template=CustomTemplate)
metric.measure(...)
```
