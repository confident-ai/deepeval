import Equation from "@site/src/components/equation";

The contextual precision metric measures your RAG pipeline's retriever by evaluating whether nodes in your `retrieval_context` that are relevant to the given `input` are ranked higher than irrelevant ones. `deepeval`'s contextual precision metric is a self-explaining LLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

## Required Arguments

To use the `ContextualPrecisionMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an [`LLMTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#llm-test-case):

- `input`
- `expected_output`
- `retrieval_context`

## Example

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import ContextualPrecisionMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Replace this with the expected output from your RAG generator
expected_output = "You are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."

# Replace this with the actual retrieved context from your RAG pipeline
retrieval_context = ["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]

metric = ContextualPrecisionMetric(
    threshold=0.7,
    model="gpt-4",
    include_reason=True
)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    expected_output=expected_output,
    retrieval_context=retrieval_context
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)

# or evaluate test cases in bulk
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

There are six optional parameters when creating a `ContextualPrecisionMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `ContextualPrecisionMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Contextual Precision} = \frac{1}{\text{Number of Relevant Nodes}} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Nodes Up to Position } k}{k} \times r_{k} \right)" />

:::info

- **_k_** is the (i+1)<sup>th</sup> node in the `retrieval_context`
- **_n_** is the length of the `retrieval_context`
- **_r<sub>k</sub>_** is the binary relevance for the k<sup>th</sup> node in the `retrieval_context`. _r<sub>k</sub>_ = 1 for nodes that are relevant, 0 if not.

:::

The `ContextualPrecisionMetric` first uses an LLM to determine for each node in the `retrieval_context` whether it is relevant to the `input` based on information in the `expected_output`, before calculating the **weighted cumulative precision** as the contextual precision score. The weighted cumulative precision (WCP) is used because it:

- **Emphasizes on Top Results**: WCP places a stronger emphasis on the relevance of top-ranked results. This emphasis is important because LLMs tend to give more attention to earlier nodes in the `retrieval_context` (which may cause downstream hallucination if nodes are ranked incorrectly).
- **Rewards Relevant Ordering**: WCP can handle varying degrees of relevance (e.g., "highly relevant", "somewhat relevant", "not relevant"). This is in contrast to metrics like precision, which treats all retrieved nodes as equally important.

A higher contextual precision score represents a greater ability of the retrieval system to correctly rank relevant nodes higher in the `retrieval_context`.
