The summarization metric uses LLMs to determine whether your LLM (application) is generating factually correct summaries while including the neccessary details from the original text. In a summarization task within `deepeval`, the original text refers to the `input` while the summary is the `actual_output`.

## Required Arguments

To use the `SummarizationMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`

## Example

Let's take this `input` and `actual_output` as an example:

```python
# This is the original text to be summarized
input = """
The 'inclusion score' is calculated as the percentage of assessment questions
for which both the summary and the original document provide a 'yes' answer. This
method ensures that the summary not only includes key information from the original
text but also accurately represents it. A higher inclusion score indicates a
more comprehensive and faithful summary, signifying that the summary effectively
encapsulates the crucial points and details from the original content.
"""

# This is the summary, replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
actual_output="""
The inclusion score quantifies how well a summary captures and
accurately represents key information from the original text,
with a higher score indicating greater comprehensiveness.
"""
```

You can use the `SummarizationMetric` as follows:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import SummarizationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
...

test_case = LLMTestCase(input=input, actual_output=actual_output)
metric = SummarizationMetric(
    threshold=0.5,
    model="gpt-4",
    assessment_questions=[
        "Is the inclusion score based on a percentage of 'yes' answers?",
        "Does the score ensure the summary's accuracy with the source?",
        "Does a higher score mean a more comprehensive summary?"
    ]
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)

# or evaluate test cases in bulk
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

There are five optional parameters when instantiating an `SummarizationMetric` class:

- [Optional] `threshold`: the passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4-1106-preview'.
- [Optional] `assessment_questions`: a list of **close-ended questions that can be answered with either a 'yes' or a 'no'**. These are questions you want your summary to be able to ideally answer, and is especially helpful if you already know what a good summary for your use case looks like. If `assessment_questions` is not provided, we will generate a set of `assessment_questions` for you at evaluation time. The `assessment_questions` are used to calculate the `inclusion_score`.
- [Optional] `n`: the number of assessment questions to generate when `assessment_questions` is not provided. Defaulted to 5.

## How is it calculated?

In `deepeval`, we judge summarization by taking the minimum of the two distinct scores:

- `alignment_score`: determines whether the summary contains hallucinated or contradictory information to the original text.
- `inclusion_score`: determines whether the summary contains the neccessary information from the original text.

These scores are calculated by generating `n` closed-ended questions that can only be answered with either a 'yes or a 'no', and calculating the ratio of which the original text and summary yields the same answer. [Here is a great article](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/a-step-by-step-guide-to-evaluating-an-llm-text-summarization-task) on how `deepeval`'s summarization metric was build.

You can access the `alignment_score` and `inclusion_score` from a `SummarizationMetric` as follows:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import SummarizationMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
...

test_case = LLMTestCase(...)
metric = SummarizationMetric(...)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.alignment_score)
print(metric.inclusion_score)
```

:::note
Since the summarization score is the minimum of the `alignment_score` and `inclusion_score`, a 0 value for either one of these scores will result in a final summarization score of 0.
