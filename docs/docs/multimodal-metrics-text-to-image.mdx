The Text to Image metric assesses the performance of **image generation tasks** by evaluating the quality of synthesized images based on semantic consistency and perceptual quality. `deepeval`'s Text to Image metric is a self-explaining MLLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

:::tip
The Text to Image metric achieves scores **comparable to human evaluations** when GPT-4v is used as the evaluation model. This metric excels in artifact detection.

## Required Arguments

To use the `TextToImageMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`MLLMTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#mllm-test-case):

- `input`
- `actual_output`

:::note
The input should contain exactly **0 images**, and the output should contain exactly **1 image**.
:::

The `input` and `actual_output` are required to create an `MLLMTestCase` (and hence required by all metrics) even though they might not be used for metric calculation. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import TextToImageMetric
from deepeval.test_case import MLLMTestCase, MLLMImage

metric = TextToImageMetric(
    threshold=0.7,
    include_reason=True,
)
m_test_case = MLLMTestCase(
    input=["Generate an image of a blue pair of shoes."],
    # Replace with your MLLM app output
    actual_output=[MLLMImage(url="https://shoe-images.com/edited-shoes", local=False)],
)


evaluate(test_cases=[m_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **FIVE** optional parameters when creating a `TextToImageMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

### As a standalone

You can also run the `TextToImageMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(m_test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `TextToImageMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="O = \sqrt{\text{min}(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_i) \cdot \text{min}(\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_i)}" />

The `TextToImageMetric` score combines Semantic Consistency (SC) and Perceptual Quality (PQ) sub-scores to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the synthesized image. The final overall score is derived by taking the square root of the product of the minimum SC and PQ scores.

### SC Scores

These scores assess aspects such as alignment with the prompt and resemblance to concepts. The minimum value among these sub-scores represents the SC score. During the SC evaluation, both the input conditions and the synthesized image are used.

### PQ Scores

These scores evaluate the naturalness and absence of artifacts in the image. The minimum value among these sub-scores represents the PQ score. For the PQ evaluation, only the synthesized image is used to prevent confusion from the input conditions.
