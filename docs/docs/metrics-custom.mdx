`deepeval` allows you to implement your own evaluator (for example, your own GPT evaluator) by creating a custom metric. All custom metrics are automatically integrated with the deepeval ecosystem, which includes Confident AI.

## Required Arguments

To use a custom metric, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`

You'll also need to supply any additional arguments such as `expected_output` and `context` if your custom metric's `measure()` method is dependent on these parameters.

## Implementation

To create a custom metric, you'll need to inherite `deepeval`'s `BaseMetric` class, and implement abstract methods and properties such as `measure()`, `is_successful()`, and `name()`. Here's an example:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import BaseMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Inherit BaseMetric
class LatencyMetric(BaseMetric):
    # This metric by default checks if the latency is greater than 10 seconds
    def __init__(self, max_seconds: int=10):
        self.threshold = max_seconds

    def measure(self, test_case: LLMTestCase):
        # Set self.success and self.score in the "measure" method
        self.success = test_case.latency <= self.threshold
        if self.success:
            self.score = 1
        else:
            self.score = 0

        # You can also optionally set a reason for the score returned.
        # This is particularly useful for a score computed using LLMs
        self.reason = "Too slow!"
        return self.score

    def is_successful(self):
        return self.success

    @property
    def __name__(self):
        return "Latency"
```

Notice that a few things has happened:

- `self.threshold` was set in `__init__()`, and this can be either a minimum or maximum threshold
- `self.success`, `self.score`, and `self.reason` was set in `measure()`
- `measure()` takes in an `LLMTestCase`
- `is_successful()` simply returns the success status
- `__name()__` simply returns a string representing the metric name

To create a custom metric without unexpected errors, we recommend you set the appropriate class variables in the appropriate methods as outlined above. You should also note that `self.reason` is **optional**. `self.reason` should be a string representing the rationale behind an LLM computed score. This is only applicable if you're using LLMs as an evaluator in the `measure()` method, and has implemented a way to generate a score reasoning.

After creating a custom metric, you can use it in the same way as all of `deepeval`'s metrics:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
...

# Note that we pass in latency since the measure method requires it for evaluation
latency_metric = LatencyMetric(max_seconds=10.0)
test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...", latency=8.3)
evaluate([test_case], [latency_metric])
```
