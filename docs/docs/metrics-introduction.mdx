## Quick Summary

In `deepeval`, a metric serves as a standard of measurement for evaluating the performance of an LLM output based on a specific criteria of interest. Essentially, while the metric acts as the ruler, a test case represents the thing you're trying to measure. `deepeval` offers a range of default metrics for you to quickly get started with, such as:

- Hallucination
- Summarization
- Faithfulness
- Answer Relevancy
- Contextual Relevancy
- Contextual Precision
- Contextual Recall
- Ragas
- Toxicity
- Bias

`deepeval` also offers you a straightforward way to develop your own custom evaluation metrics. All metrics are measured on a test case. Visit the [test cases section](evaluation-test-cases) to learn how to apply any metric on test cases for evaluation.

## Types of Metrics

A **_custom_** metric is a type of metric you can easily create by implementing abstract methods and properties of base classes provided by `deepeval`. They are extremely versitle and seamlessly integrate with Confident AI without requiring any additional setup. As you'll see later, a custom metric can either be an **_LLM-Eval_** (LLM evaluated) or **_classic_** metric. A classic metric is a type of metric whose criteria isn't evaluated using an LLM.

`deepeval` also offer **_default_** metrics. Most default metrics offered by `deepeval` are LLM-Evals, which means they are evaluated using LLMs. This is delibrate because LLM-Evals are versitle in nature and better aligns with human expectations when compared to traditional model based approaches.

`deepeval`'s LLM-Evals are a step up to other implementations because they:

- are extra reliable as LLMs are only used for extremely specific tasks during evaluation to greatly reduce stochasticity and flakiness in scores.
- provide a comprehensive reason for the scores computed.

All of `deepeval`'s default metrics output a score between 0-1, and require a `threshold` argument to instantiate. A default metric is only successful if the evaluation score is equal to or greater than `threshold`.

:::info
All GPT models from OpenAI are available for LLM-Evals (metrics that use LLMs for evaluation). You can switch between models by providing a string corresponding to OpenAI's model names via the optional `model` argument when instantiating an LLM-Eval.

## Using OpenAI

To use OpenAI for `deepeval`'s LLM-Evals (metrics evaluated using an LLM), supply your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the CLI:

```console
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```

Alternatively, if you're working in a notebook enviornment (Jupyter or Colab), set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in a cell:

```console
 %env OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```

:::note
Please **do not include** quotation marks when setting your `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you're working in a notebook enviornment.

## Using Azure OpenAI

`deepeval` also allows you to use Azure OpenAI for metrics that are evaluated using an LLM. Run the following command in the CLI to configure your `deepeval` enviornment to use Azure OpenAI for **all** LLM-based metrics.

```console
deepeval set-azure-openai --openai-endpoint=<endpoint> \
    --openai-api-key=<api_key> \
    --deployment-name=<deployment_name> \
    --openai-api-version=<openai_api_version> \
    --model-version=<model_version>
```

Note that the `model-version` is **optional**. If you ever wish to stop using Azure OpenAI and move back to regular OpenAI, simply run:

```console
deepeval unset-azure-openai
```

## Using a Custom LLM

We highly discourage the use of custom LLMs since evaluation requires a high level of reasoning capabilities that we find are generally not reachable apart from (Azure) OpenAI's GPT models.

But to use a custom LLM for evaluation, `deepeval` metrics currently supports all of langchain's [Chat Models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/), which you can provide through the `model` argument when instantiating an LLM-based metric:

```python
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI

custom_azure_openai_model = AzureChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_version=openai_api_version,
    azure_deployment=azure_deployment,
    azure_endpoint=azure_endpoint,
    openai_api_key=openai_api_key,
)

answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(model=custom_azure_openai_model)
```

:::note
While the Azure OpenAI command configures `deepeval` to use Azure OpenAI globally for all LLM-Evals, a custom LLM is not. Remember to provide your custom LLM instance through the `model` parameter for metrics you wish to use it for.

## Measuring a Metric

All metrics in `deepeval`, including [custom metrics that you create](metrics-custom):

- can be executed via the `metric.measure()` method
- can have its score accessed via `metric.score`
- can have its status accessed via `metric.is_successful()`
- can be used to evaluate test cases or entire datasets, with or without Pytest.
- has a `threshold` that acts as the threshold for success. `metric.is_successful()` is only true if `metric.score` >= `threshold`.

In additional, most LLM-Evals in `deepeval` offers a reason for its score, which can be accessed via `metric.reason`.

Here's a quick example.

```console
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```

```python
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Initialize a test case
test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")

# Initialize metric with threshold
metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)
```

Using this metric, you can either evaluate a test case using `deepeval test run`:

```python title="test_file.py"
from deepeval import evaluate
...

def test_answer_relevancy():
    assert_test(test_case, metric)
```

```console
deepeval test run test_file.py
```

Or using the `evaluate` function:

```python
from deepeval import assert_test
...

evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

Or execute the metric directly and get its score:

```python
...

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)
```

For more details on how a metric evaluates a test case, refer to the [test cases section.](evaluation-test-cases#assert-test-cases)
