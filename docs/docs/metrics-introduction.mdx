## Quick Summary

In `deepeval`, a metric serves as a standard of measurement for evaluating the performance of an LLM output based on a specific criteria of interest. Essentially, while the metric acts as the ruler, a test case represents the thing you're trying to measure. `deepeval` offers a range of default metrics for you to quickly get started with, such as:

- G-Eval
- Summarization
- Faithfulness
- Answer Relevancy
- Contextual Relevancy
- Contextual Precision
- Contextual Recall
- Ragas
- Hallucination
- Toxicity
- Bias

`deepeval` also offers you a straightforward way to develop your own custom evaluation metrics. All metrics are measured on a test case. Visit the [test cases section](evaluation-test-cases) to learn how to apply any metric on test cases for evaluation.

## Types of Metrics

A **_custom_** metric is a type of metric you can easily create by implementing abstract methods and properties of base classes provided by `deepeval`. They are extremely versitle and seamlessly integrate with Confident AI without requiring any additional setup. As you'll see later, a custom metric can either be an **_LLM-Eval_** (LLM evaluated) or **_classic_** metric. A classic metric is a type of metric whose criteria isn't evaluated using an LLM.

`deepeval` also offer **_default_** metrics. Most default metrics offered by `deepeval` are LLM-Evals, which means they are evaluated using LLMs. This is delibrate because LLM-Evals are versitle in nature and better aligns with human expectations when compared to traditional model based approaches.

`deepeval`'s LLM-Evals are a step up to other implementations because they:

- are extra reliable as LLMs are only used for extremely specific tasks during evaluation to greatly reduce stochasticity and flakiness in scores.
- provide a comprehensive reason for the scores computed.

All of `deepeval`'s default metrics output a score between 0-1, and require a `threshold` argument to instantiate. A default metric is only successful if the evaluation score is equal to or greater than `threshold`.

:::info
All GPT models from OpenAI are available for LLM-Evals (metrics that use LLMs for evaluation). You can switch between models by providing a string corresponding to OpenAI's model names via the optional `model` argument when instantiating an LLM-Eval.
:::

## Using OpenAI

To use OpenAI for `deepeval`'s LLM-Evals (metrics evaluated using an LLM), supply your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the CLI:

```console
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```

Alternatively, if you're working in a notebook enviornment (Jupyter or Colab), set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in a cell:

```console
 %env OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```

:::note
Please **do not include** quotation marks when setting your `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you're working in a notebook enviornment.
:::

## Using Azure OpenAI

`deepeval` also allows you to use Azure OpenAI for metrics that are evaluated using an LLM. Run the following command in the CLI to configure your `deepeval` enviornment to use Azure OpenAI for **all** LLM-based metrics.

```console
deepeval set-azure-openai --openai-endpoint=<endpoint> \
    --openai-api-key=<api_key> \
    --deployment-name=<deployment_name> \
    --openai-api-version=<openai_api_version> \
    --model-version=<model_version>
```

Note that the `model-version` is **optional**. If you ever wish to stop using Azure OpenAI and move back to regular OpenAI, simply run:

```console
deepeval unset-azure-openai
```

## Using a Custom LLM

`deepeval` allows you to use **ANY** custom LLM for evaluation. This includes LLMs from langchain's `chat_model` module, Hugging Face's `transformers` library, or even LLMs in GGML format.

:::warning
We **CANNOT** guarantee that evaluations will work as expected when using a custom model. This is because evaluation requires high levels of reasoning and the ability to follow instructions such as outputing responses in JSON formats, which are generally hard to achieve with custom LLMs.
:::

### Azure OpenAI Example

Here is an example of creating a custom Azure OpenAI model through langchain's `AzureChatOpenAI` module for evaluation:

```python
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI
from deepeval.models.base import DeepEvalBaseLLM

class AzureOpenAI(DeepEvalBaseLLM):
    def __init__(
        self,
        model
    ):
        self.model = model

    def load_model(self):
        return self.model

    def _call(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        chat_model = self.load_model()
        return chat_model.invoke(prompt).content

    def get_model_name(self):
        return "Custom Azure OpenAI Model"

# Replace these with real values
custom_model = AzureChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_version=openai_api_version,
    azure_deployment=azure_deployment,
    azure_endpoint=azure_endpoint,
    openai_api_key=openai_api_key,
)
azure_openai = AzureOpenAI(model=custom_model)
print(azure_openai("Write me a joke"))
```

When creating a custom LLM evaluation model you should **ALWAYS**:

- inherit `DeepEvalBaseLLM`.
- implement the `load_model()` method, which will be responsible for returning a model object.
- implement the `_call()` method with **one and only one** parameter of type string that acts as the prompt to your custom LLM.
- the `_call()` method should return the final output string of your custom LLM. Note that we called `chat_model.invoke(prompt).content` to access the model output in this particular example, but this could be different depending on the implementation of your custom LLM object.
- the `get_model_name()` method simply returns a string representing the name of your LLM model.

Note that the `model` argument in the `__init__()` method can accept any type (the model string or object itself). Lastly, to use it for evaluation in LLM-based metrics:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
...

metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(model=azure_openai)
```

:::note
While the Azure OpenAI command configures `deepeval` to use Azure OpenAI globally for all LLM-Evals, a custom LLM has to be set each time you instantiate a metric. Remember to provide your custom LLM instance through the `model` parameter for metrics you wish to use it for.

### Mistral 7B Example

Here is an example of creating a custom [Mistral 7B model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/mistral) through Hugging Face's `transformers` library for evaluation:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from deepeval.models.base import DeepEvalBaseLLM

class Mistral7B(DeepEvalBaseLLM):
    def __init__(
        self,
        model,
        tokenizer
    ):
        self.model = model
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer

    def load_model(self):
        return self.model

    def _call(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        model = self.load_model()

        device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

        model_inputs = self.tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors="pt").to(device)
        model.to(device)

        generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)
        return self.tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]

    def get_model_name(self):
        return "Mistral 7B"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")

mistral_7b = Mistral7B(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
print(mistral_7b("Write me a joke"))
```

Note that for this particular implementation, we initialized our `Mistral7B` model with an additional `tokenizer` parameter, as this is required in the decoding step of the `_call()` method, unlike the `AzureOpenAI` example above. Lastly, to use it for evaluation in LLM-based metrics:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
...

metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(model=mistral_7b)
```

:::tip
You need to specify the custom evaluation model you would like to use through the `model` argument when instantiating an LLM-based metric.

### AWS Bedrock Example

Here is an example of creating a custom AWS Bedrock model through the `langchain_community.chat_models` module for evaluation:

```python
from langchain_community.chat_models import BedrockChat
from deepeval.models.base import DeepEvalBaseLLM

class AWSBedrock(DeepEvalBaseLLM):
    def __init__(
        self,
        model
    ):
        self.model = model

    def load_model(self):
        return self.model

    def _call(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        chat_model = self.load_model()
        return chat_model.invoke(prompt).content

    def get_model_name(self):
        return "Custom Azure OpenAI Model"

# Replace these with real values
custom_model = BedrockChat(
    credentials_profile_name=<your-profile-name>, # e.g. "default"
    region_name=<your-region-name>, # e.g. "us-east-1"
    endpoint_url=<your-bedrock-endpoint>, # e.g. "https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
    model_id=<your-model-id>, # e.g. "anthropic.claude-v2"
    model_kwargs={"temperature": 0.4},
)

aws_bedrock = AWSBedrock(model=custom_model)
print(aws_bedrock("Write me a joke"))
```

Finally, supply the newly created `aws_bedrock` model to LLM-Evals:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
...

metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(model=aws_bedrock)
```

## Measuring a Metric

All metrics in `deepeval`, including [custom metrics that you create](metrics-custom):

- can be executed via the `metric.measure()` method
- can have its score accessed via `metric.score`
- can have its status accessed via `metric.is_successful()`
- can be used to evaluate test cases or entire datasets, with or without Pytest.
- has a `threshold` that acts as the threshold for success. `metric.is_successful()` is only true if `metric.score` >= `threshold`.

In additional, most LLM-Evals in `deepeval` offers a reason for its score, which can be accessed via `metric.reason`.

Here's a quick example.

```console
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```

```python
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Initialize a test case
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="...",
    actual_output="...",
    retrieval_context=["..."]
)

# Initialize metric with threshold
metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)
```

Using this metric, you can either execute it directly as a standalone to get its score and reason:

```python
...

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)
```

Or you can either evaluate a test case using `deepeval test run`:

```python title="test_file.py"
from deepeval import assert_test
...

def test_answer_relevancy():
    assert_test(test_case, metric)
```

```console
deepeval test run test_file.py
```

Or using the `evaluate` function:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
...

evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

For more details on how a metric evaluates a test case, refer to the [test cases section.](evaluation-test-cases#assert-a-test-case)
