import Equation from "@site/src/components/equation";

The conversation relevancy metric is a conversational metric that determines whether your LLM is able to consistently generate relevant responses **throughout a conversation**.

## Required Arguments

To use the `ConversationRelevancyMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`s for each turn in a `ConversationalTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`

## Example

Let's take this conversation as an example:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, ConversationalTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import ConversationRelevancyMetric

convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")]
)
metric = ConversationRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)

metric.measure(convo_test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)
```

There are seven optional parameters when creating a `ConversationRelevancyMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `window_size`: an integer which defines the size of the sliding window of turns used during evaluation. Defaulted to 3.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `ConversationRelevancyMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Conversation Relevancy} = \frac{\text{Number of Turns with Relevant Actual Outputs}}{\text{Total Number of Turns}}" />

The `ConversationRelevancyMetric` first constructs a sliding windows of turns for each turn, before using an LLM to determine whether the last turn in each sliding window has an `actual_output` that is relevant to the `input` based on previous conversational context found in the sliding window.
