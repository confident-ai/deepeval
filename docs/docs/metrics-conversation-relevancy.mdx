<MetricTagsDisplayer chatbot={true} referenceless={true} />

The conversation relevancy metric is a conversational metric that determines whether your LLM chatbot is able to consistently generate relevant responses **throughout a conversation**.

## Required Arguments

To use the `ConversationRelevancyMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`ConversationalTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#conversational-test-case):

- `turns`

Additionally, each `LLMTestCase`s in `turns` requires the following arguments:

- `input`
- `actual_output`

## Usage

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, ConversationalTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import ConversationRelevancyMetric

convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")]
)
metric = ConversationRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(convo_test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[convo_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **SEVEN** optional parameters when creating a `ConversationRelevancyMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `window_size`: an integer which defines the size of the sliding window of turns used during evaluation. Defaulted to 3.

### As a standalone

You can also run the `ContextualRelevancyMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(convo_test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.
:::

## How Is It Calculated?

The `ConversationRelevancyMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Conversation Relevancy} = \frac{\text{Number of Turns with Relevant Actual Outputs}}{\text{Total Number of Turns}}" />

The `ConversationRelevancyMetric` first constructs a sliding windows of turns for each turn, before using an LLM to determine whether the last turn in each sliding window has an `actual_output` that is relevant to the `input` based on previous conversational context found in the sliding window.
