The MCP argument correctness metric is a conversational metric that uses LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate how effectively an **MCP based LLM generates arguments for prompt, resoruce and tool calls**. Argument Correctness is a self-explaining LLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

## Required Arguments

To use the `MCPArgsCorrectnessMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`ConversationalTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases):

- `turns`
- `mcp_data`

You will also need to provide `mcp_tools_called`, `mcp_resources_called` and `mcp_prompts_called` inside the turns whenever there is an MCP interaction in your agent's workflow. You can learn more about [creating MCP test cases here](https://www.deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-mcp).

Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

The `MCPArgsCorrectnessMetric()` can be used for [end-to-end](/docs/evaluation-end-to-end-llm-evals) multi-turn evaluations of MCP based agents.

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import MCPArgsCorrectnessMetric
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase, MCPMetaData

convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[Turn(role="...", content="..."), Turn(role="...", content="...")],
    mcp_data=[MCPMetaData(...)]
)
metric = MCPArgsCorrectnessMetric(threshold=0.5)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(convo_test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[convo_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **SEVEN** optional parameters when creating a `MCPArgsCorrectnessMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-a-metric-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

### As a standalone

You can also run the `MCPArgsCorrectnessMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(convo_test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.

## How Is It Calculated

The `MCPArgsCorrectnessMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{MCP Args Correctness} = \frac{\text{AlignmentScore(PrimitiveCall, Args)}}{\text{Total Number of PrimitiveCalls}}" />

- **PrimitiveCalls** are extracted from the unit interactions in turns.
- The **Alignment Score** measures whether the args used for this tool in this task is accurate and correct, it is judged by an LLM.
