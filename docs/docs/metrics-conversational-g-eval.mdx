<MetricTagsDisplayer custom={true} chatbot={true} />

The conversational G-Eval is an adopted version of `deepeval`'s popular [`GEval` metric](/docs/metrics-llm-evals) but for evaluating entire conversations instead.

It is currently the best way to define custom criteria to evaluate multi-turn conversations in `deepeval`. By defining a custom `ConversationalGEval`, you can easily determine whether your LLM chatbot is able to consistently generate responses that are up to standard with your custom criteria **throughout a conversation**.

## Required Arguments

To use the `ConversationalGEval` metric, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`ConversationalTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases):

- `turns`

You'll also want to supply any additional arguments such as `retrieval_context` and `tools_called` in `turns` if your evaluation criteria depends on these parameters.

## Usage

To create a custom metric that evaluates entire LLM conversations, simply instantiate a `ConversationalGEval` class and define an evaluation criteria in everyday language:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, TurnParams, ConversationalTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import ConversationalGEval

convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[Turn(role="...", content="..."), Turn(role="...", content="...")]
)
professionalism_metric = ConversationalGEval(
    name="Professionalism",
    criteria="Determine whether the assistant has acted professionally based on the content."
)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(convo_test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[convo_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **THREE** mandatory and **SIX** optional parameters required when instantiating an `ConversationalGEval` class:

- `name`: name of metric. This will **not** affect the evaluation.
- `criteria`: a description outlining the specific evaluation aspects for each test case.
- [Optional] `evaluation_params`: a list of type `TurnParams`, include only the parameters that are relevant for evaluation. Defaulted to `[TurnParams.CONTENT]`.
- [Optional] `evaluation_steps`: a list of strings outlining the exact steps the LLM should take for evaluation. If `evaluation_steps` is not provided, `ConversationalGEval` will generate a series of `evaluation_steps` on your behalf based on the provided `criteria`. You can only provide either `evaluation_steps` **OR** `criteria`, and not both.
- [Optional] `threshold`: the passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4.1'.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

:::danger
For accurate and valid results, only turn parameters that are mentioned in `criteria`/`evaluation_steps` should be included as a member of `evaluation_params`.
:::

### As a standalone

You can also run the `ConversationalGEval` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(convo_test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.
:::

## How Is It Calculated?

The `ConversationalGEval` is an adapted version of [`GEval`](/docs/metrics-llm-evals), so alike `GEval`, the `ConversationalGEval` metric is a two-step algorithm that first generates a series of `evaluation_steps` using chain of thoughts (CoTs) based on the given `criteria`, before using the generated `evaluation_steps` to determine the final score using the `evaluation_params` presented in each turn.

Unlike regular `GEval` though, the `ConversationalGEval` takes the entire conversation history into account during evaluation.

:::tip
Similar to the original [G-Eval paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634), the `ConversationalGEval` metric uses the probabilities of the LLM output tokens to normalize the score by calculating a weighted summation. This step was introduced in the paper to minimize bias in LLM scoring, and is automatically handled by `deepeval` (unless you're using a custom LLM).
