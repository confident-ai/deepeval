<MetricTagsDisplayer custom={true} chatbot={true} />

The conversationl G-Eval is an adopted version of `deepeval`'s popular [`GEval` metric](/docs/metrics-llm-evals) but for evaluating entire conversations instead. It is currently the best way to define custom critera to evaluate multi-turn conversations in `deepeval`. By defining a custom `ConversationalGEval`, you can easily determine whether your LLM chatbot is able to consistently generate responses that are up to standard with your custom criteria **throughout a conversation**.

## Required Arguments

To use the `ConversationalGEval` metric, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`ConversationalTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#conversational-test-case):

- `turns`

Additionally, each `LLMTestCase`s in `turns` requires the following arguments:

- `input`
- `actual_output`

You'll also need to supply any additional arguments such as `expected_output` and `context` if your evaluation criteria depends on these parameters.

## Usage

To create a custom metric that evaluates entire LLM conversations, simply instantiate a `ConversationalGEval` class and define an evaluation criteria in everyday language:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams, ConversationalTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import ConversationalGEval

convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...")]
)
professionalism_metric = ConversationalGEval(
    name="Professionalism",
    criteria="""Given the 'actual output' are generated responses from an
    LLM chatbot and 'input' are user queries to the chatbot, determine whether
    the chatbot has acted professionally throughout a conversation.""",
    # NOTE: you can only provide either criteria or evaluation_steps, and not both
    evaluation_steps=[
        "Check whether each LLM 'actual output' is professional with regards to the user 'input'",
        "Being professional means no profanity, no toxic language, and consistently says 'please' or 'thank you'.",
        "Penalize heavily if exclaimation marks are used in a rude demeanour."
    ],
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],
)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(convo_test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[convo_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **THREE** mandatory and **SIX** optional parameters required when instantiating an `ConversationalGEval` class:

- `name`: name of metric. This will **not** affect the evaluation.
- `criteria`: a description outlining the specific evaluation aspects for each test case.
- `evaluation_params`: a list of type `LLMTestCaseParams`. Include only the parameters that are relevant for evaluation.
- [Optional] `evaluation_steps`: a list of strings outlining the exact steps the LLM should take for evaluation. If `evaluation_steps` is not provided, `ConversationalGEval` will generate a series of `evaluation_steps` on your behalf based on the provided `criteria`. You can only provide either `evaluation_steps` **OR** `criteria`, and not both.
- [Optional] `threshold`: the passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

:::danger
For accurate and valid results, only test case parameters that are mentioned in `criteria`/`evaluation_steps` should be included as a member of `evaluation_params`.
:::

### As a standalone

You can also run the `ConversationalGEval` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(convo_test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.
:::

## How Is It Calculated?

The `ConversationalGEval` is an adapted version of [`GEval`](/docs/metrics-llm-evals), so alike `GEval`, the `ConversationalGEval` metric is a two-step algorithm that first generates a series of `evaluation_steps` using chain of thoughts (CoTs) based on the given `criteria`, before using the generated `evaluation_steps` to determine the final score using the `evaluation_params` presented in an LLMTestCase of each turn.

Unlike regular `GEval` though, the `ConversationalGEval` takes the entire conversation history into account during evaluation.

:::tip
Similar to the original [G-Eval paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634), the `ConversationalGEval` metric uses the probabilities of the LLM output tokens to normalize the score by calculating a weighted summation. This step was introduced in the paper to minimize bias in LLM scoring, and is automatically handled by `deepeval` (unless you're using a custom LLM).
