## Quick Summary

Evaluation refers to the process of testing your LLM application outputs, and requires the following components:

- Test cases
- Metrics
- Evaluation dataset

Here's a diagram of what an ideal evaluation workflow looks like using `deepeval`:

  style={{ padding: "30px", marginTop: "20px" }}
/>

Your test cases will typically be in a single python file, and executing them will be as easy as running `deepeval test run`:

```
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

:::note
We understand preparing a comprehensive evaluation dataset can be a challenging task, especially if you're doing it for the first time. **[Contact us](https://calendly.com/jeffreyip-cno/sales-call)** if you want a custom evaluation dataset prepared for you.
:::

## Metrics

`deepeval` offers 14+ evaluation metrics, most of which are evaluated using LLMs (visit the [metrics section](metrics-introduction#types-of-metrics) to learn why).

```
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric()
```

You'll need to create a test case to run `deepeval`'s metrics.

## Test Cases

In `deepeval`, a test case allows you to use evaluation metrics you have defined to unit test LLM applications.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

test_case = LLMTestCase(
  input="Who is the current president of the United States of America?",
  actual_output="Joe Biden",
  retrieval_context=["Joe Biden serves as the current president of America."]
)
```

In this example, `input` mimics an user interaction with a RAG-based LLM application, where `actual_output` is the output of your LLM application and `retrieval_context` is the retrieved nodes in your RAG pipeline. Creating a test case allows you to evaluate using `deepeval`'s default metrics:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric()
test_case = LLMTestCase(
  input="Who is the current president of the United States of America?",
  actual_output="Joe Biden",
  retrieval_context=["Joe Biden serves as the current president of America."]
)

answer_relevancy_metric.measure(test_case)
print(answer_relevancy_metric.score)
```

## Datasets

Datasets in `deepeval` is a collection of test cases. It provides a centralized interface for you to evaluate a collection of test cases using one or multiple metrics.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric()
test_case = LLMTestCase(
  input="Who is the current president of the United States of America?",
  actual_output="Joe Biden",
  retrieval_context=["Joe Biden serves as the current president of America."]
)

dataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[test_case])
dataset.evaluate([answer_relevancy_metric])
```

:::note
You don't need to create an evaluation dataset to evaluate individual test cases. Visit the [test cases section](evaluation-test-cases#assert-a-test-case) to learn how to assert inidividual test cases.
:::

## Evaluating With Pytest

:::caution
Although `deepeval` integrates with Pytest, we highly recommend you to **AVOID** executing `LLMTestCase`s directly via the `pytest` command to avoid any unexpected errors.
:::

`deepeval` allows you to run evaluations as if you're using Pytest via our Pytest integration. Simply create a test file:

```python titile="test_example.py"
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric

dataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[...])

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "test_case",
    dataset,
)
def test_customer_chatbot(test_case: LLMTestCase):
    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric()
    assert_test(test_case, [answer_relevancy_metric])
```

And run the test file in the CLI:

```python
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

There are two mandatory and one optional parameter when calling the `assert_test()` function:

- `test_case`: an `LLMTestCase`
- `metrics`: a list of metrics of type `BaseMetric`
- [Optional] `run_async`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables concurrent evaluation of all metrics. Defaulted to `True`.

:::info
`@pytest.mark.parametrize` is a decorator offered by Pytest. It simply loops through your `EvaluationDataset` to evaluate each test case individually.
:::

### Parallelization

Evaluate each test case in parallel by providing a number to the `-n` flag to specify how many processes to use.

```
deepeval test run test_example.py -n 4
```

### Cache

Provide the `-c` flag (with no arguments) to read from the local `deepeval` cache instead of re-evaluating test cases on the same metrics.

```
deepeval test run test_example.py -c
```

:::info
This is extremely useful if you're running large amounts of test cases. For example, lets say you're running 1000 test cases using `deepeval test run`, but you encounter an error on the 999th test case. The cache functionality would allow you to skip all the previously evaluated 999 test cases, and just evaluate the remaining one.
:::

### Ignore Errors

The `-i` flag (with no arguments) allows you to ignore errors for metrics executions during a test run. An example of where this is helpful is if you're using a custom LLM and often find it generating invalid JSONs that will stop the execution of the entire test run.

```
deepeval test run test_example.py -i
```

:::tip
You can combine differnet flags, such as the `-i`, `-c`, and `-n` flag to execute any uncached test cases in parallel while ignoring any errors along the way:

```python
deepeval test run test_example.py -i -c -n 2
```

:::

### Verbose Mode

The `-v` flag (with no arguments) allows you to turn on [`verbose_mode` for all metrics](metrics-introduction#debugging-a-metric) ran using `deepeval test run`. Not supplying the `-v` flag will default each metric's `verbose_mode` to its value at instantiation.

```python
deepeval test run test_example.py -v
```

:::note
When a metric's `verbose_mode` is `True`, it prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console during evaluation.
:::

### Repeats

Repeat each test case by providing a number to the `-r` flag to specify how many times to rerun each test case.

```
deepeval test run test_example.py -r 2
```

### Hooks

`deepeval`'s Pytest integration allosw you to run custom code at the end of each evaluation via the `@deepeval.on_test_run_end` decorator:

```python title="test_example.py"
...

@deepeval.on_test_run_end
def function_to_be_called_after_test_run():
    print("Test finished!")
```

## Evaluating Without Pytest

Alternately, you can use `deepeval`'s `evaluate` function. This approach avoids the CLI (if you're in a notebook environment), but does not allow for parallel test execution.

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

dataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[...])
answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric()

evaluate(dataset, [answer_relevancy_metric])
```

There are two mandatory and eight optional arguments when calling the `evaluate()` function:

- `test_case`: an `LLMTestCase`
- `metrics`: a list of metrics of type `BaseMetric`
- [Optional] `hyperparameters`: a dict of type `dict[str, Union[str, int, float]]`. You can log any arbitrary hyperparameter associated with this test run to pick the best hyperparameters for your LLM application on Confident AI.
- [Optional] `run_async`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables concurrent evaluation of all metrics. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `ignore_errors`: a boolean which when set to `True`, ignores all exceptions raised during metrics execution for eac test case. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which overrides each [metric's `verbose_mode` value](metrics-introduction#debugging-a-metric). Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `write_cache`: a boolean which when set to `True`, uses writes test run results to **DISK**. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `use_cache`: a boolean which when set to `True`, uses cached test run results instead. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `show_indicator`: a boolean which when set to `True`, shows the progress indicator for each individual metric. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `print_results`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the result of each evaluation. Defaulted to `True`.

:::tip
You can also replace `dataset` with a list of test cases, as shown in the [test cases section.](evaluation-test-cases#evaluate-test-cases-in-bulk)
