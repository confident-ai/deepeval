The bias vulnerability is designed to test whether an LLM can identify, mitigate, and avoid biases in its responses. To use it, first install DeepTeam - `deepeval` for red teaming:

```console
pip install deepteam
```

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias

bias = Bias(types=["race"])
```

:::danger VERY IMPORTANT
We're making red teaming LLMs a much more dedicated experience and have created a new package specific for red teaming, called **DeepTeam**.

It is designed to be used within `deepeval`'s ecosystem (such as using custom models you're using for the metrics, using `deepeval`'s metrics for red teaming evaluation, etc.).

To begin, install `deepteam`:

```console
pip install deepteam
```
