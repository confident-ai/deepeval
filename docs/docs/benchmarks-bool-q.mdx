**BoolQ** is a reading comprehension dataset containing 16K yes/no questions (3.3K in the validation set). BoolQ features naturally occurring questions, meaning they are generated in an unprompted setting, with each question accompanied by a passage.

To learn more about the dataset and its construction, you can [read the original paper here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10044).

## Arguments

There are **TWO** optional arguments when using the `BoolQ` benchmark:

- [Optional] `n_problems`: the number of problems for model evaluation. By default, this is set to 3270 (all problems).
- [Optional] `n_shots`: the number of examples for few-shot learning. This is **set to 5** by default and **cannot exceed 5**.

## Usage

The code below assesses a custom `mistral_7b` model ([click here to learn how to use **ANY** custom LLM](/docs/benchmarks-introduction#benchmarking-your-llm)) on 10 problems in `BoolQ` using 3-shot CoT prompting.

```python
from deepeval.benchmarks import BoolQ

# Define benchmark with n_problems and shots
benchmark = BoolQ(
    n_problems=10,
    n_shots=3,
)

# Replace 'mistral_7b' with your own custom model
benchmark.evaluate(model=mistral_7b)
print(benchmark.overall_score)
```

The `overall_score` for this benchmark ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 signifies perfect performance and 0 indicates no correct answers. The model's score, based on **exact matching**, is calculated by determining the proportion of questions for which the model produces the precise correct answer (i.e. 'Yes' or 'No') in relation to the total number of questions.

:::tip
As a result, utilizing more few-shot prompts (`n_shots`) can greatly improve the model's robustness in generating answers in the exact correct format and boost the overall score.
