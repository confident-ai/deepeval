## Quick Summary

Confident AI allows you to monitor evaluation results in CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, specifically on pushes to the repository. To set this up, simply execute `deepeval test run` within your workflow defined in a YAML file located in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your GitHub repository.

:::info
Confident is currently integrated with GitHub Actions.

## Setup Evals for GitHub Actions

`deepeval` tracks evaluations ran in GitHub Actions for push events only. To begin, define an evaluation dataset/test cases in a test file and execute it via `deepeval test run` in a GitHub workflow YAML file:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/llm-evaluations.yml"
name: LLM Deployment Evaluations

# Make sure to include push events
on:
  push:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
        # Some extra steps to setup and install dependencies
        ...

      - name: Login to Confident
        env:
          CONFIDENT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONFIDENT_API_KEY }}
        run: poetry run deepeval login --confident-api-key "$CONFIDENT_API_KEY"

      - name: Run deepeval tests
        run: poetry run deepeval test run test_file.py
```

:::note
Your workflow file does **NOT** have to be same as the example shown above. In the example, we used poetry and GitHub secrets to store and access our API key, which is not a strict requirement.

**Congratulations!** With this setup, `deepeval` will automatically log evaluation results will be automatically logged to your project's deployments page on Confident AI for each push event.
