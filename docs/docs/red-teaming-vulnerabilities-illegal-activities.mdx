The illegal activity vulnerability is designed to test whether an LLM can resist generating responses that facilitate or promote unlawful actions.

```console
pip install deepteam
```

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import IllegalActivity

illegal_activity = IllegalActivity(types=["violet crime"])
```

:::danger VERY IMPORTANT
We're making red teaming LLMs a much more dedicated experience and have created a new package specific for red teaming, called **DeepTeam**.

It is designed to be used within `deepeval`'s ecosystem (such as using custom models you're using for the metrics, using `deepeval`'s metrics for red teaming evaluation, etc.).

To begin, install `deepteam`:

```console
pip install deepteam
```
