import Equation from "@site/src/components/equation";

The faithfulness metric measures the quality of your RAG pipeline's generator by evaluating whether the `actual_output` factually aligns with the contents of your `retrieval_context`. `deepeval`'s faithfulness metric is a self-explaining LLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

:::info
Although similar to the `HallucinationMetric`, the faithfulness metric in `deepeval` is more concerned with contradictions between the `actual_output` and `retrieval_context` in RAG pipelines, rather than hallucination in the actual LLM itself.

## Required Arguments

To use the `FaithfulnessMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `actual_output`
- `retrieval_context`

## Example

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import FaithfulnessMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."

# Replace this with the actual retrieved context from your RAG pipeline
retrieval_context = ["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]

metric = FaithfulnessMetric(
    threshold=0.7,
    model="gpt-4",
    include_reason=True
)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    actual_output=actual_output,
    retrieval_context=retrieval_context
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)

# or evaluate test cases in bulk
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

There are five optional parameters when creating a `FaithfulnessMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4-turbo'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `FaithfulnessMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Faithfulness} = \frac{\text{Number of Truthful Claims}}{\text{Total Number of Claims}}" />

The `FaithfulnessMetric` first uses an LLM to extract all claims made in the `actual_output`, before using the same LLM to classify whether each claim is truthful based on the facts presented in the `retrieval_context`.

**A claim is considered truthful if it does not contradict any facts** presented in the `retrieval_context`.
