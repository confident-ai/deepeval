The Image Coherence metric assesses the **coherent alignment of images with their accompanying text**, evaluating how effectively the visual content complements and enhances the textual narrative. `deepeval`'s Image Coherence metric is a self-explaining MLLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

:::info
Image Coherence evaluates MLLM responses containing text accompanied by retrieved or generated images.

## Required Arguments

To use the `ImageCoherence`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`MLLMTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#mllm-test-case):

- `input`
- `actual_output`

The `input` and `actual_output` are required to create an `MLLMTestCase` (and hence required by all metrics) even though they might not be used for metric calculation. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import ImageCoherenceMetric
from deepeval.test_case import MLLMTestCase, MLLMImage

metric = ImageCoherenceMetric(
    threshold=0.7,
    include_reason=True,
)
m_test_case = MLLMTestCase(
    input=["Provide step-by-step instructions on how to fold a paper airplane."],
    actual_output=[
      # Replace this with the output of your LLM app
      "1. Take the sheet of paper and fold it lengthwise",
      MLLMImage(url="./paper_plane_1", local=True),
      "2. Unfold the paper. Fold the top left and right corners towards the center.",
      MLLMImage(url="./paper_plane_2", local=True),
  ]
)


evaluate(test_cases=[m_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **FIVE** optional parameters when creating a `ImageCoherence`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `max_context_size`: a number representing the maximum number of characters in each context, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `None`.

### As a standalone

You can also run the `ImageCoherenceMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(m_test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

## How Is It Calculated?

The `ImageCoherence` score is calculated as follows:

1. **Individual Image Coherence**: Each image's coherence score is based on the text directly above and below the image, limited by a `max_context_size` in characters. If `max_context_size` is not supplied, all available text is used. The equation can be expressed as:

<Equation formula="C_i = f(\text{Context}_{\text{above}}, \text{Context}_{\text{below}}, \text{Image}_i)" />

2. **Final Score**: The overall `ImageCoherence` score is the average of all individual image coherence scores for each image:

<Equation formula="O = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n C_i}{n}" />
