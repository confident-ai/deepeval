## Quick Summary

**Chroma** is one of the most popular open-source AI application databases, and supports many retrieval features such as embeddings storage, vector search, document storage, metadata filtering, and multi-modal retrieval.

DeepEval allows you to easily evaluate and optimize your Chroma retriever by **tuning hyperparameters** like `n_results` (more commonly known as top-K) and the `embedding model` used in your Chroma retrieval pipeline.

:::info
To get started, install Chroma through the CLI using the following command:

```
pip install chromadb
```

:::

To learn more about using Chroma for your RAG pipeline, [visit this page](https://www.trychroma.com/). The diagram below illustrates how you can utilize Chroma as the entire retrieval pipeline for your LLM application.

## Setup Chroma

To get started with **Chroma**, initialize a persistent client and create a collection to store your documents. The collection acts as a vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings, while the persistent client ensures data is retained across sessions.

```python
import chromadb

# Initialize Chroma client
client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./chroma_db")

# Create or load a collection
collection = client.get_or_create_collection(name="rag_documents")
```

Next, define an **embedding model** (we'll use `sentence_transformers`) to convert document chunks into vectors before adding them to your Chroma collection, along with the document chunks as metadata.

```python
...

# Load an embedding model
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Example document chunks
document_chunks = [
    "Chroma is an open-source vector database for efficient embedding retrieval.",
    "It enables fast semantic search using vector similarity.",
    "Chroma retrieves relevant data with cosine similarity.",
    ...
]

# Store chunks with embeddings in Chroma
for i, chunk in enumerate(document_chunks):
    embedding = model.encode(chunk).tolist()  # Convert text to vector
    collection.add(
        ids=[str(i)],  # Unique ID for each document
        embeddings=[embedding],  # Vector representation
        metadatas=[{"text": chunk}]  # Store original text as metadata
    )
```

You'll be querying from this Chroma collection during generation to retrieve relevant contexts based on the user `input`, before passing them along with your input into your LLM's prompt template.

:::note
By default, Chroma utilizes `cosine similarity` to find similar chunks.
:::

## Evaluating Chroma Retrieval

To evaluate your Chroma retriever, you'll first need to prepare an `input` query and generate a response from your RAG pipeline in order to create an `LLMTestCase`. You'll also need to extract the contexts retrieved from your Chroma collection during generation and prepare the expected LLM response to complete the `LLMTestCase`.

:::information
By default, `input` and `actual_output` are required for all metrics. However, `retrieval_context`, `context`, and `expected_output` are optional, and different metrics may or may not require additional parameters. To check the specific requirements, [visit the metrics section](/docs/metrics-introduction).  
:::

After you've prepared your `LLMTestCase`, evaluating your Chroma retriever is as easy passing the test case along with your selection of metrics into DeepEval's `evaluate` function.

### Preparing your Test Case

To prepare our test case, we'll be using `"How does Chroma work?"` as our input. Before generating a response from your RAG pipeline, you'll first need to retrieve the relevant context using a `search` function. Our `search` function in the example below first embeds the input query before retrieving the top three most relevant text chunks (`n_results=3`) from our chroma collection.

```python
...

def search(query):
    query_embedding = model.encode(query).tolist()

    res = collection.query(
        query_embeddings=[query_embedding],
        n_results=3  # Retrieve top-K matches
    )

    return res["metadatas"][0][0]["text"] if res["metadatas"][0] else None

query = "How does Chroma work?"
retrieval_context = search(query)
```

Next, we'll pass the retrieved context from our Chroma collection into the LLM's prompt template to generate the final response.

```python
...

prompt = """
Answer the user question based on the supporting context.

User Question:
{input}

Supporting Context:
{retrieval_context}
"""

actual_output = generate(prompt)  # Replace with your LLM function
print(actual_output)
print(expected_output)
```

Printing the `actual_output` generated by our RAG pipeline yields the following example:

```
Chroma is a lightweight vector database designed for AI applications, enabling fast semantic retrieval.
```

Let's compare this to the `expected_output` we've prepared:

```
Chroma is an open-source vector database that enables fast retrieval using cosine similarity.
```

With all the elements ready, we'll create an `LLMTestCase` by providing the input and expected output, along with the actual output and retrieved context.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

...

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=actual_output,
    retrieval_context=retrieval_context,
    expected_output=expected_output
)
```

### Running Evaluations

To begin running evaluations, we'll need to define metrics relevant to our Chroma retriever. These include `ContextualRecallMetric`, `ContextualPrecisionMetric`, and `ContextualRelevancyMetric`, which specifically evaluate RAG retrievers.

:::tip
To learn more about how these metrics are calculated and why they're relevant to retrievers, visit the [individual metric pages](/docs/metrics-contextual-precision).
:::

```python
from deepeval.metrics import (
    ContextualPrecisionMetric,
    ContextualRecallMetric,
    ContextualRelevancyMetric,
)

contextual_precision = ContextualPrecisionMetric()
contextual_recall = ContextualRecallMetric(),
contextual_relevancy = ontextualRelevancyMetric()
```

To run evaluations, simply pass the prepared test case you've prepared into the `evaluate` function, along with the retriever metrics you defined.

```
from deepeval import evaluate

...

evaluate(
    [test_case],
    metrics=[contextual_recall, contextual_precision, contextual_relevancy]
)
```

## Improving Chroma Retrieval

Hypothetically, we've run multiple inputs and prepared several test cases, consistently observing that the `Contextual Relevancy` score is below the required threshold.

| <div style={{width: "350px"}}>Inputs</div> | <div style={{width: "250px"}}>Contextual Relevancy Score</div> | <div style={{width: "250px"}}>Contextual Recall Score</div> |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| "How does Chroma work?"                    | 0.45                                                           | 0.85                                                        |
| "What is the retrieval process in Chroma?" | 0.43                                                           | 0.92                                                        |
| "Explain Chroma's vector database."        | 0.55                                                           | 0.67                                                        |

This suggests that you may need to adjust the length of each document or tweak `n_results` to retrieve more relevant contexts from your Chroma collection. This is because Contextual Relevancy evaluates both the **retrieved text chunks and the top-K selection**.

:::

Depending on the failing scores in your retriever, you'll want to experiment with different parameters (e.g., `n_results`, `embedding model`, etc.) in your Chroma retrieval pipeline until you're satisfied with the results. This can be as simple as writing a for loop to run evaluations many times:

```python
...

def search(query, n_results):
    query_embedding = model.encode(query).tolist()

    res = collection.query(
        query_embeddings=[query_embedding],
        n_results=n_results  # Retrieve top-K matches
    )

    return res["metadatas"][0][0]["text"] if res["metadatas"][0] else None


# Define input and expected output
...

# Iterate over different top-K values
for top_k in [3, 5, 7]:
    retrieval_context = search(input_query, top_k)

    # Define test case
    ...

    # Evaluate the retrieval quality
    evaluate(
        [test_case],
        metrics=[contextual_recall, contextual_precision, contextual_relevancy]
    )
```
