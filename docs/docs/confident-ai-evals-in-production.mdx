## Quick Summary

`deepeval` allows you to live monitor LLM responses in production, which you can **enable real-time evaluations** on. By monitoring responses, you can leverage our hosted evaluation infrastructure to identify unsatisfactory LLM responses, have human annotators send feedback to such responses, and improve your evaluation dataset over time.

## Monitoring Live Responses

To monitor LLM responses, use the `deepeval.track(...)` method in your LLM application to start tracking responses.

```python
import deepeval

# At the end of your LLM call,
# usually in your backend API handler
deepeval.track(
    event_name="Chatbot",
    model="gpt-4",
    input="input",
    response="response"
)
```

There are four mandatory and ten optional parameters when using the `track()` function to monitor responses in production:

- `event_name`: type `str` specifying the type of event tracked.
- `model`: type `str` specifying the name of the LLM model used.
- `input`: type `str`.
- `response`: type `str`.
- [Optional] `retrieval_context`: type `list[str]` that indicates the context that were retrieved in your RAG pipeline.
- [Optional] `additional_data`: type `dict[str, Union[str, dict, Link]]`. [See below](confident-ai-evals-in-production#tracking-additional-custom-data) for further details.
- [Optional] `hyperparameters`: type `dict[str, Union[str, int, float]]`. You can provide a dictionary to specify any additional hyperparamters used to generate the response.
- [Optional] `distinct_id`: type `str` to identify **end users** using your LLM application.
- [Optional] `conversation_id`: type `str` to **group together multiple messages** under a single conversation thread.
- [Optional] `completion_time`: type `float` that indicates how many **seconds** it took your LLM application to complete.
- [Optional] `token_usage`: type `float`
- [Optional] `token_cost`: type `float`
- [Optional] `fail_silently`: type `bool`. You should set this to `False` in development to check if tracking is working properly. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `raise_expection`: type `bool`. You should set this to `False` in production if you don't want to raise expections in production. Defaulted to `True`.

:::caution
Please do **NOT** provide placeholder values for optional parameters. Leave it blank instead.
:::

The `track()` function returns an `event_id` upon a successful API request to Confident's servers, which you can later use to send human feedback regarding a particular LLM response you've tracked.

```python
import deepeval

event_id = deepeval.track(...)
```

**Congratulations!** With a few lines of code, `deepeval` will now automatically log all LLM responses in production to Confident AI.

### Tracking Custom Hyperparameters

In addition to tracking which `model` was used to generate each response, you can also associate any custom hyperparameters you wish to each response you're tracking.

```python
import deepeval

deepeval.track(
    ...
    model="gpt-4",
    hyperparameters={
        "prompt template": "...",
        "temperature": 1,
        "chunk size": 500
    }
)
```

:::info
Logging hyperparameters allows you to more easily filter and search for different responses on Confident AI.
:::

### Tracking Additional Custom Data

Similar to hyperparameters, you can easily associate custom additional data for each response.

```python
import deepeval
from deepeval.events.api import Link

deepeval.track(
    ...
    additional_data={
        "Example Text": "...",
        # the Link class allows you to access the link directly on Confident AI
        "Example Link": Link(value="https://www.youtube.com"),
        "Example list of Links": [Link(value="https://www.instagram.com")],
        "Example JSON": {"Any Key": "Any Value"}
    },
)
```

Note that you can log either text, a `Link`, list of `Link`s, or any custom dict (as shown in the "Example Json"). Similar to hyperparameter, you can also filter and search for different responses based on the provided custom data.

:::tip Did you know?
Although you can technically log a link as a native string, the `Link(value="...")` class allows you to access said link directly on Confident AI. You should also aim to have your `Link`s start with 'https://...'.

## Sending Human Feedback

`deepeval` allows you to send human feedback for a particular LLM response by specifying an `event_id` returned through the `track()` function.

There are two types of feedback:

- **User provided feedback.** A user feedback, is feedback provided by your end users. If you're building a discord bot for example, this will likely be the users interacting with your discord bot on a daily basis.
- **Reviewer provided feedback.** A reviewer feedback, is feedback provided by your LLM quality assurance personnel, whoever they might be. These might be data annotators and labellers, or even domain experts that checking the quality of LLM responses in production.

Using the `event_id` returned from `track()`, here's how you can send feedback to Confident:

```python
import deepeval

event_id = deepeval.track(...)

deepeval.send_feedback(
    event_id=event_id,
    provider="user",
    rating=6,
    explanation="...",
    expected_response="..."
)
```

There are three mandatory and four optional parameters when using the `send_feedback()` function:

- `event_id`: a string representing the `event_id` returned from the `deepeval.track()` function.
- `provider`: a string of either `"user"` **OR** `"reviewer"` to specify the type of feedback provider.
- `rating`: an integer ranging from 1 - 5, inclusive.
- [Optional] `explanation`: a string that serves as the explanation for the given rating.
- [Optional] `expected_response`: a string representing what the ideal response is.
- [Optional] `fail_silently`: a boolean which when set to `True` will neither print nor raise any exceptions on error. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `raise_expection`: a boolean which when set to `True` will not raise any expections on error. Defaulted to `True`.

## Responses on Confident AI

Confident offers an observatory to view responses and identify ones where you want to augment your evaluation dataset with.

If you're building an LLM chatbot, you can also view entire conversation threads via the `conversation_id`.

## Enable Real-Time Evals

To monitor how your LLM application is performing over time, and be alerted of any unsatisfactory LLM responses in production, head to the "projects details" section via the left navigation drawer to turn on the metrics you wish to enable in production. Confident AI will automatically run evaluations for enabled metrics for all incoming events.
