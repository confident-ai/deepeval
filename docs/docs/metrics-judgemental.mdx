`JudgementalGPT` is an LLM agent developed in-house by [Confident AI](https://confident-ai.com) that's dedicated to evaluation and is superior to `LLMEvalMetric`. While it operates similarly to `LLMEvalMetric` by utilizing LLMs for scoring, it:

- offers enhanced accuracy and reliability.
- is capable of generating justifications for its scores
- has the ability to conditionally execute code that helps detect logical fallacies during evaluations

## Required Test Case Arguments

To use `JudgementalGPT`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`

Similar to `LLMEvalMetric`, you'll also need to supply any additional arguments such as `expected_output` and `context` if your evaluation criteria depends on these parameters.

## Example

To use `JudgementalGPT`, start by logging into Confident AI:

```console
deepeval login
```

Then paste in the following code to define a metric powered by `JudgementalGPT`:

```python
from deepeval.types import Languages
from deepeval.metrics import JudgementalGPT
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCaseParams

code_correctness_metric = JudgementalGPT(
    name="Code Correctness",
    criteria="Code Correctness - determine whether the code in the 'actual output' produces a valid JSON.",
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],
    language=Languages.SPANISH,
    threshold=0.5,
)
```

Under the hood, `JudgementalGPT` sends a request to Confident AI's servers that hosts `JudgementalGPT`. `JudgementalGPT` accepts four arguments:

- `name`: name of metric
- `criteria`: a description outlining the specific evaluation aspects for each test case.
- `evaluation_params`: a list of type `LLMTestCaseParams`. Include only the parameters that are relevant for evaluation.
- [Optional] `language`: type `Language`, specifies what language to return the reasoning in.
- [Optional] `threshold`: the passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.

Similar to `LLMEvalMetric`, you can access the judgemental `score` and `reason` for `JudgementalGPT`:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
...

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="Show me a valid json",
    actual_output="{'valid': 'json'}"
)

code_correctness_metric.measure(test_case)
print(code_correctness_metric.score)
print(code_correctness_metric.reason)
```
