<MetricTagsDisplayer multiTurn={true} chatbot={true} referenceFree={false} />

The turn faithfulness metric is a conversational metric that determines whether your LLM chatbot generates factually accurate responses grounded in the retrieval context **throughout a conversation**.

## Required Arguments

To use the `TurnFaithfulnessMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`ConversationalTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases):

- `turns`

You must provide the `role`, `content`, and `retrieval_context` for evaluation to happen. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

The `TurnFaithfulnessMetric()` can be used for [end-to-end](/docs/evaluation-end-to-end-llm-evals) multi-turn evaluation:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import TurnFaithfulnessMetric

convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[
        Turn(role="user", content="...", retrieval_context=["..."]),
        Turn(role="assistant", content="...", retrieval_context=["..."])
    ]
)
metric = TurnFaithfulnessMetric(threshold=0.5)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(convo_test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[convo_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **NINE** optional parameters when creating a `TurnFaithfulnessMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4.1'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `window_size`: an integer which defines the size of the sliding window of turns used during evaluation. Defaulted to `10`.
- [Optional] `truths_extraction_limit`: an optional integer to limit the number of truths extracted from retrieval context per document. Defaulted to `None`.
- [Optional] `penalize_ambiguous_claims`: a boolean which when set to `True`, penalizes claims that cannot be verified as true or false. Defaulted to `False`.

### As a standalone

You can also run the `TurnFaithfulnessMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(convo_test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `TurnFaithfulnessMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Turn Faithfulness} = \frac{\sum \text{Interaction Faithfulness Scores}}{\text{Number of Interactions}}" />

The `TurnFaithfulnessMetric` first constructs unit interactions of `user` and `assistant` exchanges from the entire conversation. For each interaction, it:

1. **Extracts truths** from the retrieval context provided in the turns
2. **Generates claims** from the assistant's responses in the interaction
3. **Evaluates verdicts** by checking if each claim contradicts the truths
4. **Calculates the interaction score** as the ratio of faithful claims to total claims

<Equation formula="\text{Faithfulness} = \frac{\text{Number of Truthful Claims}}{\text{Total Number of Claims}}" />

The final score is the average of all interaction faithfulness scores across the conversation.
