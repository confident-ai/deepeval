DeepEval enables you to **generate synthetic Goldens from an existing set of Goldens**, without requiring any documents or context. This is ideal for quickly expanding or adding more complexity to your evaluation dataset.

:::tip
By default, `generate_goldens_from_goldens` extracts `StylingConfig` from your existing Golden, but it is recommended to [provide a `StylingConfig` explicitly](/docs/synthesizer-introduction#styling-options) for better accuracy and consistency.

## Generate Your Goldens

To get started, simply define a `Synthesizer` object and pass in your list of existing Goldens to the `generate_goldens_from_goldens` method.

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_goldens(
  goldens=goldens,
  max_goldens_per_golden=2,
  include_expected_output=True,
)
```

There is **ONE** mandatory and **TWO** optional parameter when using the `generate_goldens_from_goldens` method:

- `goldens`: a list of existing Goldens from which the new Goldens will be generated.
- [Optional] `max_goldens_per_golden`: the maximum number of goldens to be generated per golden. Defaulted to 2.
- [Optional] `include_expected_output`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will additionally generate an `expected_output` for each synthetic `Golden`. Defaulted to `True`.

:::info
If your existing Goldens include `context`, the synthesizer will utilize these contexts to generate synthetic Goldens, ensuring they are grounded in truth. If no context is present, the synthesizer will employ the `generate_from_scratch` method to create additional inputs based on provided inputs.
