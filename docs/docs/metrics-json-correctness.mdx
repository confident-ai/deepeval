The json correctness metric measures whether your LLM application is able to generate `actual_output`s with the correct **json schema**.

:::note

The `JsonCorrectnessMetric` like the `ToolCorrectnessMetric` is not an LLM-eval, and you'll have to supply your expected Json schema when creating a `JsonCorrectnessMetric`.

:::

## Required Arguments

To use the `JsonCorrectnessMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an [`LLMTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#llm-test-case):

- `input`
- `actual_output`

The `input` and `actual_output` are required to create an `LLMTestCase` (and hence required by all metrics) even though they might not be used for metric calculation. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

First define your schema by creating a `pydantic` `BaseModel`:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleSchema(BaseModel):
    name: str
```

:::tip
If your `actual_output` is a list of JSON objects, you can simply create a list schema by wrapping your existing schema in a `RootModel`. For example:

```python
from pydantic import RootModel
from typing import List

...

class ExampleSchemaList(RootModel[List[ExampleSchema]]):
    pass
```

:::

Then supply it as the `expected_schema` when creating a `JsonCorrectnessMetric`:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import JsonCorrectnessMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase


metric = JsonCorrectnessMetric(
    expected_schema=ExampleSchema,
    model="gpt-4",
    include_reason=True
)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="Output me a random Json with the 'name' key",
    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
    actual_output="{'name': null}"
)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **ONE** mandatory and **SIX** optional parameters when creating an `PromptAlignmentMetric`:

- `expected_schema`: a `pydantic` `BaseModel` specifying the schema of the Json that is expected from your LLM.
- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use to generate reasons, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-a-metric-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

:::info
Unlike other metrics, the `model` is used for generating reason instead of evaluation. It will only be used if the `actual_output` has the wrong schema, **AND** if `include_reason` is set to `True`.
:::

### As a standalone

You can also run the `JsonCorrectnessMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.
:::

## How Is It Calculated?

The `PromptAlignmentMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation
  formula="\text{Json Corectness} = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{If the actual output fits the expected schema}, \\
0 & \text{Otherwise}
\end{cases}"
/>

The `JsonCorrectnessMetric` does not use an LLM for evaluation and instead uses the provided `expected_schema` to determine whether the `actual_output` can be loaded into the schema.
