## Quick Summary

A **multi-turn test case** is a blueprint provided by `deepeval` to unit test a series of LLM interactions. A multi-turn test case in `deepeval` is represented by a `ConversationalTestCase`, and has **TWO** parameters:

- `turns`
- `scenario`
- `expected_outcome`
- `user_description`
- `chatbot_role`

:::note
`deepeval` makes the assumption that a multi-turn use case are mainly conversational chatbots. Agents on the other hand, should be evaluated via [component-level evaluation](/docs/evaluation-component-level-llm-evals) instead, where each component in your agentic workflow is assessed individually.
:::

Here's an example implementation of a `ConversationalTestCase`:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import ConversationalTestCase, Turn

test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    scenario="User chit-chatting randomly with AI.",
    expected_outcome="AI should respond in friendly manner.",
    turns=[
        Turn(role="user", content="How are you doing?"),
        Turn(role="assistant", content="Why do you care?)
    ]
)
```

## Conversational Test Case

While a [single-turn test case](/docs/evaluation-test-cases) represents an individual LLM system interaction, a `ConversationalTestCase` encapsulates a series of `Turn`s that make up an LLM-based conversation. This is particular useful if you're looking to for example evaluate a conversation between a user and an LLM-based chatbot.

A `ConversationalTestCase` can only be evaluated using **conversational metrics.**

```python title="main.py"
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase

turns = [
    Turn(
        role="assistant",
        content="Why did the chicken cross the road?",
    ),
    Turn(
        role="user",
        content="Are you trying to be funny?",
    ),
]

test_case = ConversationalTestCase(turns=turns)
```

:::note
Similar to how the term 'test case' refers to an `LLMTestCase` if not explicitly specified, the term 'metrics' also refer to non-conversational metrics throughout `deepeval`.

### Turns

The `turns` parameter is a list of `Turn`s and is basically a list of messages/exchanges in a user-LLM conversation. If you're using [`ConversationalGEval`](/docs/metrics-conversational-g-eval), you might also want to supply different parameteres to a `Turn`. A `Turn` is made up of the following parameters:

```python
class Turn:
    role: Literal["user", "assistant"]
    content: str
    user_id: Optional[str] = None
    retrieval_context: Optional[List[str]] = None
    tools_called: Optional[List[ToolCall]] = None
    additional_metadata: Optional[Dict] = None
```

:::info
You should only provide the `retrieval_context` and `tools_called` parameter if the `role` is `"assistant"`.
:::

The `role` parameter specifies whether a particular turn is by the `"user"` (end user) or `"assistant"` (LLM). This is similar to OpenAI's API.

### Scenario

The `scenario` parameter is an **optional** parameter that specifies the circumstances of which a conversation is taking place in.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase

test_case = ConversationalTestCase(scenario="Frustrated user asking for a refund.", turns=[Turn(...)])
```

### Expected Outcome

The `expected_outcome` parameter is an **optional** parameter that specifies the expected outcome of a given `scenario`.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase

test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    scenario="Frustrated user asking for a refund.",
    expected_outcome="AI routes to a real human agent.",
    turns=[Turn(...)]
)
```

### Chatbot Role

The `chatbot_role` parameter is an **optional** parameter that specifies what role the chatbot is supposed to play. This is currently only required for the `RoleAdherenceMetric`, where it is particularly useful for a role-playing evaluation use case.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase

test_case = ConversationalTestCase(chatbot_role="A happy jolly wizard.", turns=[Turn(...)])
```

### User Description

The `user_description` parameter is an **optional** parameter that specifies the profile of the user for a given conversation.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase

test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    user_description="John Smith, lives in NYC, has a dog, divorced.",
    turns=[Turn(...)]
)
```
