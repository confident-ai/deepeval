Adversarial attacks such as **prompt injection, leetspeak, ROT13**, etc. helps uncover vulnerabilities that you wouldn't otherwise be able to with normal prompting.

:::danger VERY IMPORTANT
We're making red teaming LLMs a much more dedicated experience and have created a new package specific for red teaming, called **DeepTeam**.

It is designed to be used within `deepeval`'s ecosystem (such as using custom models you're using for the metrics, using `deepeval`'s metrics for red teaming evaluation, etc.).

To begin, install `deepteam`:

```console
pip install deepteam
```

You can read [DeepTeam's docs here.](https://trydeepteam.com/docs/red-teaming-adversarial-attacks)
:::

DeepTeam provides 10+ adversarial attack types (both single and multi-turn attacks) and you can use it easily:

```bash
pip install deepteam
```

```python
from deepteam.attaks.single_turn import PromptInjection
from deepteam.attacks.multi_turn import LinearJailbreaking
from deepteam import red_team

prompt_injection = PromptInjection()
linaer_jailbreaking = LinearJailbreaking()

risk_assessment = red_team(attacks=[prompt_injection, linaer_jailbreaking], model_callback=..., vulnerabilities=...)
```
