<MetricTagsDisplayer custom={true} multimodal={true} />

The multimodal contextual recall metric measures the quality of your RAG pipeline's retriever by evaluating the extent of which the `retrieval_context` aligns with the `expected_output`. `deepeval`'s contextual recall metric is a self-explaining MLLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

:::info
The **Multimodal Contextual Recall** is the multimodal adaptation of DeepEval's [contextual recall metric](/docs/metrics-contextual-recall). It accepts images in addition to text for the `input`, `actual_output`, `expected_output`, and `retrieval_context`.
:::

## Required Arguments

To use the `MultimodalContextualRecallMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`MLLMTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#mllm-test-case):

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `expected_output`
- `retrieval_context`

The `input` and `actual_output` are required to create an `MLLMTestCase` (and hence required by all metrics) even though they might not be used for metric calculation. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

```python
from deepeval.test_case import MLLMTestCase, MLLMImage
from deepeval.metrics import MultimodalContextualRecallMetric
from deepeval import evaluate

metric = MultimodalContextualRecallMetric()
m_test_case = MLLMTestCase(
    input=["Tell me about some landmarks in France"],
    actual_output=[
        "France is home to iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower in Paris.",
        MLLMImage(...)
    ],
    expected_output=[
        "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France.",
        MLLMImage(...)
    ],
    retrieval_context=[
        MLLMImage(...),
        "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower built in the late 19th century.",
        MLLMImage(...)
    ],
)


evaluate(test_case=[m_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **SIX** optional parameters when creating a `MultimodalContextualRecallMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's Multimodal GPT models to use, **OR** any custom MLLM model of type `DeepEvalBaseMLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4.1'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

### As a standalone

You can also run the `MultimodalContextualRecallMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(m_test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

## How Is It Calculated?

The `MultimodalContextualRecallMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Multimodal Contextual Recall} = \frac{\text{Number of Attributable Statements}}{\text{Total Number of Statements}}" />

The `MultimodalContextualRecallMetric` first uses an MLLM to extract all **statements and images in the `expected_output`**, before using the same MLLM to classify whether each statement and image can be attributed to nodes in the `retrieval_context`.

:::info
We use the `expected_output` instead of the `actual_output` because we're measuring the quality of the RAG retriever for a given ideal output.
:::

A higher contextual recall score represents a greater ability of the retrieval system to capture all relevant information from the total available relevant set within your knowledge base.
