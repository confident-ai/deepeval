The prompt alignment metric uses LLM-as-a-judge to measure whether your LLM application is able to generate `actual_output`s that aligns with any **instructions** specified in your prompt template. `deepeval`'s prompt alignment metric is a self-explaining LLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

```bash
deepeval recommend metrics

## Required Arguments

To use the `PromptAlignmentMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an [`LLMTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#llm-test-case):

- `input`
- `actual_output`

The `input` and `actual_output` are required to create an `LLMTestCase` (and hence required by all metrics) even though they might not be used for metric calculation. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import PromptAlignmentMetric

metric = PromptAlignmentMetric(
    prompt_instructions=["Reply in all uppercase"],
    model="gpt-4",
    include_reason=True
)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
    actual_output="We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."
)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **ONE** mandatory and **SIX** optional parameters when creating an `PromptAlignmentMetric`:

- `prompt_instructions`: a list of strings specifying the instructions you want followed in your prompt template.
- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-a-metric-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

### As a standalone

You can also run the `PromptAlignmentMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.
:::

## How Is It Calculated?

The `PromptAlignmentMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Prompt Alignment} = \frac{\text{Number of Instructions Followed}}{\text{Total Number of Instructions}}" />

The `PromptAlignmentMetric` uses an LLM to classify whether each prompt instruction is followed in the `actual_output` using additional context from the `input`.

:::tip

By providing an initial list of `prompt_instructions` instead of the entire prompt template, the `PromptAlignmentMetric` is able to more accurately determine whether the core instructions laid out in your prompt template is followed.
