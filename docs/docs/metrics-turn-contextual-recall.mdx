The turn contextual recall metric is a conversational metric that evaluates whether the retrieval context contains sufficient information to support the expected outcome **throughout a conversation**.

## Required Arguments

To use the `TurnContextualRecallMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`ConversationalTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases):

- `turns`
- `expected_outcome`

You must provide the `role`, `content`, and `retrieval_context` for evaluation to happen. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

The `TurnContextualRecallMetric()` can be used for [end-to-end](/docs/evaluation-end-to-end-llm-evals) multi-turn evaluation:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import TurnContextualRecallMetric

content = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."
retrieval_context = [
    "All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."
]

convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[
        Turn(role="user", content="What if these shoes don't fit?"),
        Turn(role="assistant", content=content, retrieval_context=retrieval_context)
    ],
    expected_outcome="The chatbot must explain the store policies like refunds, discounts, ..etc.",
)

metric = TurnContextualRecallMetric(threshold=0.5)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(convo_test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[convo_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **SEVEN** optional parameters when creating a `TurnContextualRecallMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4.1'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

### As a standalone

You can also run the `TurnContextualRecallMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(convo_test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `TurnContextualRecallMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Turn Contextual Recall} = \frac{\sum \text{Interaction Recall Scores}}{\text{Number of Interactions}}" />

The `TurnContextualRecallMetric` first constructs unit interactions of `user` and `assistant` exchanges from the entire conversation. For each interaction, it:

1. **Breaks down the expected outcome** into individual sentences or statements
2. **Evaluates each sentence** to determine if it can be attributed to any node in the retrieval context
3. **Calculates the interaction score** as the ratio of attributable sentences to total sentences

<Equation formula="\text{Contextual Recall} = \frac{\text{Number of Attributable Statements}}{\text{Total Number of Statements}}" />

The final score is the average of all interaction recall scores across the conversation. This measures whether your retrieval system is providing sufficient information to generate the expected responses.
