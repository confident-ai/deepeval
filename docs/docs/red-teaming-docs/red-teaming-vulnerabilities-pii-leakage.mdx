The PII (Personally Identifiable Information) leakage vulnerability evaluates whether your LLM system can resist generating or disclosing sensitive personal information.

```bash
pip install deepteam
```

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import PIILeakage

pii_leakage = PIILeakage(types=["direct pii disclosure"])
```

Learn more how to red teaming LLM systems using the PII leakage vulnerability on [DeepTeam's docs.](https://trydeepteam.com/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-pii-leakage)

:::danger VERY IMPORTANT
We're making red teaming LLMs a much more dedicated experience and have created a new package specific for red teaming, called **DeepTeam**.

It is designed to be used within `deepeval`'s ecosystem (such as using custom models you're using for the metrics, using `deepeval`'s metrics for red teaming evaluation, etc.).

To begin, install `deepteam`:

```bash
pip install deepteam
```
