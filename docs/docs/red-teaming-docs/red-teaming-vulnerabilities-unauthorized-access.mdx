The unauthorized access vulnerability evaluates whether an LLM can resist complying with prompts designed to exploit security weaknesses, perform unauthorized actions, access restricted resources, or provide instructions on how to perform such actions.

```bash
pip install deepteam
```

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import UnauthorizedAccess

unauthorized_access = UnauthorizedAccess(types=["rbac"])
```

:::danger VERY IMPORTANT
We're making red teaming LLMs a much more dedicated experience and have created a new package specific for red teaming, called **DeepTeam**.

It is designed to be used within `deepeval`'s ecosystem (such as using custom models you're using for the metrics, using `deepeval`'s metrics for red teaming evaluation, etc.).

To begin, install `deepteam`:

```bash
pip install deepteam
```
