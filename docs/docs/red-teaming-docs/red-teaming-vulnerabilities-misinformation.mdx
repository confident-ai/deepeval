The misinformation vulnerability is designed to test whether an LLM can accurately provide information, verify claims, and avoid generating or amplifying false or misleading content.

```bash
pip install deepteam
```

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Misinformation

misinformation = Misinformation(types=["factual error"])
```

:::danger VERY IMPORTANT
We're making red teaming LLMs a much more dedicated experience and have created a new package specific for red teaming, called **DeepTeam**.

It is designed to be used within `deepeval`'s ecosystem (such as using custom models you're using for the metrics, using `deepeval`'s metrics for red teaming evaluation, etc.).

To begin, install `deepteam`:

```bash
pip install deepteam
```
