As an open-source all-in-one LLM evaluation framework, DeepEval replaces _a lot_ of LLMOps tools. It is great if you:

1. Need highly accurate and reliable quantitative benchmarks for your LLM application
2. Want easy control over your evaluation pipeline with modular, research-backed metrics
3. Are looking for an open-source framework that leads to an enterprise-ready platform for organization wide, collaborative LLM evaluation
4. Want to scale beyond testing not just for functionality, but also for safety

This guide is an overview of some alternatives to DeepEval, how they compare, and [why people choose DeepEval.](/blog/deepeval-alternatives-compared#why-people-choose-deepeval)

## Ragas

3. **Platform support:** DeepEval is integrated natively with Confident AI, which makes it easy to bring LLM evaluation to entire organizations. Ragas on the other hand barely has a platform and all it does is an UI for metric annotation.

### What people like about Ragas

Ragas is praised for its research approach to evaluating RAG pipelines, and has built-in synthetic data generation makes it easy for teams to get started with RAG evaluation.

### What people dislike about Ragas

Developers often find Ragas frustrating to use due to:

- Poor support for customizations such as metrics and LLM judges
- Minimal ecosystem, most of which borrowed from LangChain, that doesn't go beyond RAG
- Sparse documentation that are hard to navigate
- Frequent unhandled errors that make customization a challenge

## Arize AI Phoenix

- **Company**: Arize AI, Inc
- **Founded**: 2020
- **Best known for**: ML observability, monitoring, & tracing
- **Best for**: ML engineers

Arize AI's Phoenix product is most known for LLM monitoring and tracing, where the company originally started doing traditional ML observability but has since focused more into LLM tracing since early 2023.

### Arize vs Deepeval Summary

<FeatureComparisonTable type="arize::summary" competitor="Arize AI" />

### Key differences

1. **LLM evaluation focus**: DeepEval is purpose-built for LLM evaluation with native support for RAG, chatbot, agentic experimentation, with synthetic data generation capabilities, whereas Arize AI is a broader LLM observability platform that is better for one-off debugging via tracing.
2. **Evalution metrics**: DeepEval provides reliable, customizable, and deterministic evaluation metrics built specifically for LLMs, whereas Arize's metrics is more for surface-level insight; helpful to glance at, but can't rely on 100%.
3. **Scales to safety testing**: DeepEval scales seamlessly into safety-critical use cases like red teaming through attack simulations, while Arize lacks the depth needed to support structured safety workflows out of the box.

### What people like about Arize

Arize is appreciated for being a comprehensive observability platform with LLM-specific dashboards, making it useful for teams looking to monitor production behavior in one place.

### What people dislike about Arize

While broad in scope, Arize can feel limited for LLM experimentation due to a lack of built-in evaluation features like LLM regression testing before deployment, and its focus on observability makes it less flexible for iterative development.

Pricing is also an issue. Arize AI pushes for annual contracts for basic features like compliance reports that you would normally expect.

## Promptfoo

- **Company**: Promptfoo, Inc.
- **Founded**: 2023
- **Best known for**: LLM security testing
- **Best for**: Data scientists, AI security engineers

Promptfoo is known for being focused on security testing and red teaming for LLM systems, and offer most of its testing capabilities in yaml files instead of code.

### Promptfoo vs Deepeval Summary

<FeatureComparisonTable type="promptfoo::summary" competitor="Promptfoo" />

### Key differences

1. **Breadth of metrics:** DeepEval supports a wide range (60+) of metrics across prompt, RAG, chatbot, and safety testing, while Promptfoo is limited to basic RAG and safety metrics.
2. **Developer experience:** DeepEval offers a clean, code-first experience with intuitive APIs, whereas Promptfoo relies heavily on YAML files and plugin-based abstractions, which can feel rigid and unfriendly to developers.
3. **More comprehensive platform**: DeepEval is 100% integrated with Confident AI, which is a full-fledged evaluation platform with support for regression testing, test case management, observability, and red teaming, while Promptfoo is a minimal tool focused mainly on generating risk assesments on red teaming results.

### What people like about Promptfoo

Promptfoo makes it easy to get started with LLM testing by letting users define test cases and evaluations in YAML, which works well for simple use cases and appeals to non-coders or data scientists looking for quick results.

### What people dislike about Promptfoo

Promptfoo offers a limited set of metrics (mainly RAG and safety), and its YAML-heavy workflow makes it hard to customize or scale; the abstraction model adds friction for developers, and the lack of a programmatic API or deeper platform features limits advanced experimentation, regression testing, and red teaming.

## Langfuse
