title: DeepEval vs Trulens
description: As the open-source LLM evaluation framework, DeepEval contains everything Trulens have, but also a lot more on top of it.

**TL;DR:** TruLens offers useful tooling for basic LLM app monitoring and runtime feedback, but it’s still early-stage and lacks many core evaluation features — including agentic and conversational metrics, granular test control, and safety testing. DeepEval takes a more complete approach to LLM evaluation, supporting structured testing, CI/CD workflows, custom metrics, and integration with Confident AI for collaborative analysis, sharing, and decision-making across teams.

## What Makes DeepEval Stand Out?

### 1. Purpose-Built for Developers

DeepEval is designed by engineers with roots at Google and AI researchers from Princeton — so naturally, it's built to slot right into an engineering workflow without sacrificing metric rigor.

Key developer-focused advantages include:

- **Seamless CI/CD integration** via native pytest support
- **Composable metric modules** for flexible pipeline design
- **Cleaner error messaging** and fewer bugs
- **No vendor lock-in** — works across LLMs and frameworks
- **Extendable abstractions** built with reusable class structures
- **Readable, modifiable code** that scales with your needs
- **Ecosystem ready** — DeepEval is built to be built on

### 2. We Obsess Over Developer Experience

From docs to DX, we sweat the details. Whether it's refining error handling or breaking off red teaming into a separate package (`deepteam`), we're constantly iterating based on what you need.

Every Discord question is an opportunity to improve the product. If the docs don’t have an answer, that’s our cue to fix it.

### 3. The Community is Active (and Always On)

We're always around — literally. The team hangs out in the DeepEval Discord voice chat while working (yes, even if muted). It makes us accessible, and users feel more comfortable jumping in and asking for help. It’s part of our culture.

### 4. Fast Releases, Fast Fixes

Most issues reported in [Discord](https://discord.gg/a3K9c8GRGt) are resolved in under 3 days. If it takes longer, we communicate — and we prioritize.

When something clearly helps our users, we move fast. For instance, we shipped the full [DAG metric](/docs/metrics-dag) — code, tests, and docs — in under a week.

### 5. More Features, Fewer Bugs

Because our foundation is engineering-first, you get a broader feature set with fewer issues. We aim for graceful error handling and smooth dev experience, so you're not left guessing when something goes wrong.

Comparison tables below will show what you get with DeepEval out of the box.

### 6. Scales with Your Org

DeepEval works out of the box for teams — no extra setup needed. It integrates automatically with **Confident AI**, our dashboard for visualizing and sharing LLM evaluation results.

Without writing any additional code, you can:

- Visualize score distributions and trends
- Generate and share test reports internally or externally
- Export results to CSV or JSON
- Run regression tests for safe deployment
- Compare prompts, models, or changes side-by-side
- Manage and reuse centralized datasets

For safety-focused teams, **DeepTeam** (our red teaming toolkit) plugs right in. DeepEval is an ecosystem — not a dead end.

## Comparing DeepEval and Trulens

If you're reading this, there's a good chance you're in academia. Trulens was founded by Stanford professors and got really popular back in late 2023 and early 2024 through a DeepLearning course with Andrew Ng. However the traction slowly died after this initial boost, especially after the Snowflake acquisition.

And so, you'll find DeepEval provides a lot more well-rounded features and support for all different use cases (RAG, agentic, conversations), and completes all parts of the evaluation workflow (dataset generation, benchmarking, platform integration, etc.).

### Metrics

DeepEval does RAG evaluation very well, but it doesn't end there.

### Dataset Generation

DeepEval offers a comprehensive synthetic data generator while Trulens does not have any generation capabilities.

<FeatureComparisonTable type="trulens::synthesizer" competitor="Trulens" />

### Red teaming

Trulens offers no red teaming at all, so only DeepEval will help you as you scale to safety and security LLM testing.

<FeatureComparisonTable type="trulens::redTeaming" competitor="Trulens" />

Checkout [DeepTeam's documentation](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/getting-started), which powers DeepEval's red teaming capabilities, for more detail.

### Benchmarks

In the past, benchmarking foundational models were compute-heavy and messy. Now with DeepEval, 10 lines of code is all that is needed.

<FeatureComparisonTable type="trulens::benchmarks" competitor="Trulens" />

This is not the entire list (DeepEval has [15 benchmarks](/docs/benchmarks-introduction) and counting), and Trulens offers no benchmarks at all.

### Integrations

DeepEval offers countless integrations with the tools you are likely already building with.

### Platform

DeepEval's platform is called Confident AI, and Trulen's platform is hidden and minimal.

Confident AI is also self-served, meaning you don't have to talk to us to try it out. Sign up [here.](https://app.confident-ai.com)

## Conclusion

DeepEval offers much more features and better community, and should be more than enough to support all your LLM evaluation needs. [Get started with DeepEval here.](/docs/getting-started)
