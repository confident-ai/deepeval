**TL;DR:** Langfuse has strong tracing capabilities, which is useful for debugging and monitoring in production, and easy to adopt thanks to solid integrations. It supports evaluations at a basic level, but lacks advanced features for heavier experimentation like A/B testing, custom metrics, granular test control. Langfuse takes a prompt-template-based approach to metrics (similar to Arize) which can be simplistic, but lacks the accuracy of research-backed metrics. The right tool depends on whether you’re focused solely on observability, or also investing in scalable, research-backed evaluation.

## How is DeepEval Different?

### 1. Evaluation-First approach

Langfuse's tracing-first approach means evaluations are built into that workflow, which works well for lightweight checks. DeepEval, by contrast, is purpose-built for LLM benchmarking—with a robust evaluation feature set that includes custom metrics, granular test control, and scalable evaluation pipelines tailored for deeper experimentation.

This means:

- **Research-backed metrics** for accurate, trustworthy evaluation results
- **Fully customizable metrics** to fit your exact use case
- **Built-in A/B testing** to compare model versions and identify top performers
- **Advanced analytics**, including per-metric breakdowns across datasets, models, and time
- **Collaborative dataset editing** to curate, iterate, and scale fast
- **End-to-end safety testing** to ensure your LLM is not just accurate, but secure
- **Team-wide collaboration** that brings engineers, researchers, and stakeholders into one loop

### 2. Team-wide collaboration

We’re obsessed with UX and DX: iterations, better error messages, and spinning off focused tools like DeepTeam (DeepEval red-teaming spinoff repo) when it provides a better experience. But DeepEval isn’t just for solo devs. It’s built for teams—engineers, researchers, and stakeholders—with shared dataset editing, public test reports, and everything you need to collaborate. LLM evals is a team effort, and we’re building for that.

### 3. Ship, ship, ship

Many of the features in DeepEval today were requested by our community. That's because we’re always active on [**DeepEval’s Discord**](https://discord.gg/a3K9c8GRGt), listening for bugs, feedback, and feature ideas. Most requests ship in under 3 days—bigger ones usually land within a week. Don’t hesitate to ask. If it helps you move faster, we’ll build it—for free.

The DAG metric is a perfect example: it went from idea to live docs in under a week. Before that, there was no clean way to define custom metrics with both full control and ease of use. Our users needed it, so we made it happen.

### 4. Lean features, more features, fewer bugs

We don’t believe in feature sprawl. Everything in DeepEval is built with purpose—to make your evaluations sharper, faster, and more reliable. No noise, just what moves the needle (more information in the table below).

We also built DeepEval as engineers from Google and AI researchers from Princeton—so we move fast, ship a lot, and don’t break things.

### 5. Founder accessibility

You’ll find us in the DeepEval Discord voice chat pretty much all the time — even if we’re muted, we’re there. It’s our way of staying open and approachable, which makes it super easy for users to hop in, say hi, or ask questions.

### 6. We scale with your evaluation needs

When you use DeepEval, everything is automatically integrated with Confident AI, which is the dashboard for analyzing DeepEval's evaluation results. This means it takes 0 extra lines of code to bring LLM evaluation to your team, and entire organization:

- Analyze metric score distributions, averages, and median scores
- Generate testing reports for you to inspect and debug test cases
- Download and save testing results as CSV/JSON
- Share testing reports within your organization and external stakeholders
- Regression testing to determine whether your LLM app is OK to deploy
- Experimentation with different models and prompts side-by-side
- Keep datasets centralized on the cloud

Moreover, at some point, you’ll need to test for safety, not just performance. DeepEval includes DeepTeam, a built-in package for red teaming and safety testing LLMs. No need to switch tools or leave the ecosystem as your evaluation needs grow.

## Comparing DeepEval and Langfuse

Langfuse has strong tracing capabilities and is easy to adopt due to solid integrations, making it a solid choice for debugging LLM applications. However, its evaluation capabilities are limited in several key areas:

- Metrics are only available as prompt templates
- No support for A/B regression testing
- No statistical analysis of metric scores
- Limited ability to experiment with prompts, models, and other LLM parameters

Prompt template-based metrics aren’t research-backed, offer limited control, and depend on single LLM outputs. They’re fine for early debugging or lightweight production checks, but they break down fast when you need structured experiments, side-by-side comparisons, or clear reporting for stakeholders.

### Metrics

Langfuse allows users to create custom metrics using prompt templates but doesn't provide out-of-the-box metrics. This means you can use any prompt template to calculate metrics, but it also means that the metrics are research-backed, and don't give you granualr score control.

### Dataset Generation

Langfuse offers a dataset management UI, but doesn't have dataset generation capabilities.

### Red teaming

We created DeepTeam, our second open-source package, to make LLM red-teaming seamless (without the need to switch tool ecosystems) and scalable—when the need for LLM safety and security testing arises.

Langfuse doesn't offer red-teaming.

Using DeepTeam for LLM red-teaming means you get the same experience from using DeepEval for evaluations, but with LLM safety and security testing.

### Benchmarks

DeepEval is the first framework to make LLM benchmarking easy and accessible. Previously, benchmarking meant digging through scattered repos, wrangling compute, and managing complex setups. With DeepEval, you can configure your model once and run all your benchmarks in under 10 lines of code.

Langfuse doesn't offer LLM benchmarking.

<FeatureComparisonTable type="langfuse::benchmarks" competitor="Langfuse" />

This is not the entire list (DeepEval has [15 benchmarks](/docs/benchmarks-introduction) and counting).

### Integrations

Both tools offer a variety of integrations. Langfuse mainly integrates with LLM frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex for tracing, while DeepEval also supports evaluation integrations on top of observability.

<FeatureComparisonTable type="langfuse::integrations" competitor="Langfuse" />

DeepEval also integrates directly with LLM providers to power its metrics, from closed-source providers like OpenAI and Azure to open-source providers like Ollama, vLLM, and more.

### Platform

Both DeepEval and Langfuse has their own platforms. DeepEval's platform is called Confident AI, and Langfuse's platform is also called Langfuse. Confident AI is built for powerful, customizable evaluation and benchmarking. Langfuse, on the other hand, is more focused on observability.

Confident AI is also self-served, meaning you don't have to talk to us to try it out. Sign up here.

## Conclusion

If there’s one takeaway: Langfuse is built for debugging, Confident AI is built for evaluation. They overlap in places, but the difference comes down to focus — observability vs. benchmarking. If you care about both, go with Confident AI, since it gives you far more depth and flexibility when it comes to evaluation.
