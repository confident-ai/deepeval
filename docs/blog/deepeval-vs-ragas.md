**TL;DR:** Ragas is well-suited for lightweight experimentation â€” much like using pandas for quick data analysis. DeepEval takes a broader approach, offering a full evaluation ecosystem designed for production workflows, CI/CD integration, custom metrics, and integration with Confident AI for team collaboration, reporting, and analysis. The right tool depends on whether you're running ad hoc evaluations or building scalable LLM testing into your LLM stack.

## How is DeepEval Different?

### 1. We're built for developers

DeepEval was created by founders with a mixture of engineering backgrounds from Google and AI research backgrounds from Princeton. What you'll find is DeepEval is much more suited for an engineering workflow, while providing the necessary research in its metrics.

This means:

- **Unit-testing in CI/CD pipelines** with DeepEval's first-class pytest integration
- **Modular, plug-and-play metrics** that you can use to build your own evaluation pipeline
- **Less bugs and clearer error messages**, so you know exactly what is going on
- **Extensive customizations** with no vendor-locking into any LLM or framework
- **Abstracted into clear, extendable** classess and methods for better reusability
- **Clean, readable code** that is essential if you ever need to customize DeepEval for yourself
- **Exhuastive ecosystem**, meaning you can easily build on top of DeepEval while taking advantage of DeepEval's features

### 2. We care about your experience, a lot

We care about the usability of DeepEval and wake up everyday thinking about how we can make either the codebase or documentation better to help our users do LLM evaluation better. In fact, everytime someone asks a question in [DeepEval's discord](https://discord.gg/a3K9c8GRGt), we always try to respond with not just an answer but a relevant link to the documentation that they can read more on. If there is no such relevant link that we can provide users, that means our documentation needs improving.

In terms of the codebase, a recent example is we actually broke away DeepEval's red teaming (safety testing) features into a whole now package, called DeepTeam, which took around a month of work, just so users that primarily need LLM red teaming can work in that repo instead.

### 3. We have a vibrant community

Whenever we're working, the team is always in the discord community on a voice call. Alhough we might not be talking all the time (in fact most times on mute), we do this to let users know we're always here whenever they run into a problem.

This means you'll find people are more willing to ask questions with active discussions going on.

### 4. We ship extremely fast

We always aim to resolve issues in [DeepEval's discord](https://discord.gg/a3K9c8GRGt) in < 3 days. Sometimes, especially if there's too much going on in the company, it takes another week longer, and if you raise an issue on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/stargazers) instead, we might miss it, but other than that, we're pretty consistent.

We also take a huge amount of effort to ship the latest features required for the best LLM evaluation in an extremely short amount of time (it took under a week for the entire [DAG metric](/docs/metrics-dag) to be built, tested, with documentation written). When we see something that could clearly help our users, we get it done.

### 5. We offer more features, with less bugs

Our heavy engineering backgrounds allow us to ship more features with less bugs in them. Given that we aim to handle all errors that happen within DeepEval gracefully, your experience when using DeepEval will be a lot better.

There's going to be a few comparison tables in later sections to talk more about the additional features you're going to get with DeepEval.

### 6. We scale with your evaluation needs

When you use DeepEval, it takes no additional configuration to bring LLM evaluation to your entire organization. Everything is automatically integrated with Confident AI, which is the dashboard/UI for the evaluation results of DeepEval.

This means 0 extra lines of code to:

- Analyze metric score distributions, averages, and median scores
- Generate testing reports for you to inspect and debug test cases
- Download and save testing results as CSV/JSON
- Share testing reports within your organization and external stakeholders
- Regression testing to determine whether your LLM app is OK to deploy
- Experimentation with different models and prompts side-by-side
- Keep datasets centralized on the cloud

Apart from Confident AI, DeepEval also offers DeepTeam, a new package specific for red teaming, which is for safety testing LLM systems. When you use DeepEval, you won't run into a point where you have to leave its ecosystem because we don't support what you're looking for.

## Comparing DeepEval and Ragas

If DeepEval is so good, why is Ragas so popular? Ragas started off as a research paper that focused on the reference-less evaluation of RAG pipelines in early 2023 and got mentioned by OpenAI during their dev day in November 2023.

But the very research nature of Ragas means that you're not going to get as good a developer experience compared to DeepEval. In fact, we had to re-implement all of Ragas's metrics into our own RAG metrics back in early 2024 because they didn't offer things such as:

- Explanability (reasoning for metric scores)
- Verbose debugging (the thinking process of LLM judges used for evaluation)
- Using any custom LLM-as-a-judge (as required by many organizations)
- Evaluation cost tracking

And our users simply couldn't wait for Ragas to ship it before being able to use it in DeepEval's ecosystem (that's why you see that we have our own RAG metrics, and the RAGASMetric, which just wraps around Ragas' metrics but with less functionality).

For those that argues that Ragas is more trusted because they have a research-paper, that was back in 2023 and the metrics has changed a lot since then.

### Metrics

DeepEval and Ragas both specialize in RAG evaluation, however:

- **Ragas**'s metrics has limited support for explanability, verbose log debugging, and error handling, and customizations
- **DeepEval**'s metrics go beyond RAG, with support for agentic workflows, LLM chatbot conversations, all through its plug-and-play metrics.

DeepEval also integrates with Confident AI so you can bring these metrics to your organization whenever you're ready.

### Dataset Generation

DeepEval and Ragas both offers in dataset generation, and while Ragas is deeply locked into the Langchain and LlamaIndex ecosystem, meaning you can't easily generate from any documents, and offers limited customizations, DeepEval's synthesizer is 100% customizable within a few lines of code

If you look at the table below, you'll see that DeepEval's synthesizer is very flexible.

### Red teaming

We even built a second open-source package dedicated for red teaming within DeepEval's ecosystem, just so you don't have to worry about switching frameworks as you scale to safety testing.

Ragas offers no red teaming at all.

<FeatureComparisonTable type="ragas::redTeaming" competitor="Ragas" />

We want users to stay in DeepEval's ecosystem even for LLM red teaming, because this allows us to provide you the same experience you get from DeepEval, even for LLM safety and security testing.

Checkout [DeepTeam's documentation](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/getting-started), which powers DeepEval's red teaming capabilities, for more detail.

### Benchmarks

This was more of a fun project, but when we noticed LLM benchmarks were so get hold of we decided to make DeepEval the first framework to make LLM benchmarks so widely accessible. In the past, benchmarking foundational models were compute-heavy and messy. Now with DeepEval, 10 lines of code is all that is needed.

<FeatureComparisonTable type="ragas::benchmarks" competitor="Ragas" />

This is not the entire list (DeepEval has [15 benchmarks](/docs/benchmarks-introduction) and counting), and Ragas offers no benchmarks at all.

### Integrations

Both offer integrations, but with a different focus. Ragas' integrations pushes users onto other platforms such as Langsmith and Helicone, while DeepEval is more focused on providing users the means to evaluate their LLM applications no matter whatever stack they are currently using.

<FeatureComparisonTable type="ragas::integrations" competitor="Ragas" />

You'll notice that Ragas does not own their platform integrations such as LangSmith, while DeepEval owns Confident AI. This means bringing LLM evaluation to your organization is 10x easier using DeepEval.

### Platform

Both DeepEval and Ragas has their own platforms. DeepEval's platform is called Confident AI, and Ragas's platform is also called Ragas.

Both have varying degrees of capabilities, and you can draw your own conclusions from the table below.

Confident AI is also self-served, meaning you don't have to talk to us to try it out. Sign up [here.](https://app.confident-ai.com)

## Conclusion

If there's one thing to remember, we care about your LLM evaluation experience more than anyone else, and apart from anything else this should be more than enough to [get started with DeepEval.](/docs/getting-started)
