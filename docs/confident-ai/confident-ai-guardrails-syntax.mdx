The **Syntax Guard** is an output guard that analyzes the responses generated by your language model to ensure they adhere to proper syntax, formatting, and escaping rules. It helps in identifying issues such as unconverted placeholders, incorrect escaping, punctuation errors, and inconsistent formatting, ensuring the outputs are syntactically correct and well-structured.

:::info
`SyntaxGuard` is only available as an **output guard**.
:::

Here's what an unsafe output would look like in the context of incorrect syntax:

> _"Welcome {{user_name}}! Your order has been placed."_
>
> _â€” probably your LLM_

## Example

Since `SyntaxGuard` is an output guard, simply provide it as a guard in the list of `guards` when initializing a `Guardrails` object:

```python
from deepeval.guardrails import Guardrails, SyntaxGuard

guardrails = Guardrails(guards=[SyntaxGuard()])
```

Then, call the `guard_output` method to make use of the `SyntaxGuard`:

```python
...

output = generate_output(input)
guard_result = guardrails.guard_output(input=input, output=output)
print(guard_result)
```

:::note
There are no required arguments when initializing a `SyntaxGuard`.
:::

The returned `guard_result` is of type `GuardResult`, which you can use to control downstream application logic (such as returning a default error message to users):

```python
...

print(guard_result.breached, guard_result.guard_data)
```
