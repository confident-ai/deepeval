:::tip
This is particularly helpful if you wish to enable a no-code evaluation workflow for non-technical users, or simulating conversations to be evaluated in one click of a button.
:::

You can also setup an LLM endpoint that accepts a `POST` request over HTTPS to **enable users to run evaluations directly on the platform without having to code**, and start an evaluation through a click of a button instead. At a high level, you would have to provide Confident AI with the mappings to test case parameters such as the `actual_output`, `retrieval_context`, etc., and at evaluation time Confident AI will use the dataset and metrics settings you've specified for your experiment to unit test your LLM application.

### Create an LLM Endpoint

In order for Confident AI to reach your LLM application, you'll need to expose your LLM in a RESTFUL API endpoint that is accessible over the internet. These are the hard rules you **MUST** follow when setting up your endpoint:

1. Accepts a POST request over HTTPS.
2. Returns a JSON response and **MUST** contain the `actual_output` value somewhere in the returned Json object. Whether or not to supply a `retrieval_context` or `tools_called` value in your returned Json is optional, and this depends on whether the metrics you have enabled for your experiment requires these parameters.

:::caution
When Confident AI calls your LLM endpoint, it does a POST request with a data structure of this type:

```python
{
    "input": "..."
}
```

This input will be used to unit test your LLM application, and any JSON response returned will be parsed and used to deduce what the remaining test case parameters (i.e. `actual_output`) values are.

So, it is **imperative that your LLM endpoint**:

1. Parses the incoming data to extract this `input` value to carry out generations.
2. Returns the `actual_output` and any other `LLMTestCase` parameters in the JSON response with their **correct respective type**.

For those that want a recap of what types each test case parameter is of, visit the [test cases section.](/docs/evaluation-test-cases)

### Connect Your LLM Endpoint

Now that you have your endpoint up and running, all that's left is to tell Confident AI how to reach it.

:::tip
You can setup your LLM connection in **Project Settings** > **LLM Connection**. There is also a button for you to **ping your LLM endpoint** to sanity check that you've setup everything correctly.
:::

You'll have to provide the:

1.  HTTPS endpoint you've setup.
2.  The json key path to the mandaatory `actual_output` parameter, and the optional `retrieval_context` , and `tools_called` parameters. The json key path is a list of strings.

In order for evaluation to work, you **MUST** set the json key path for the `actual_output` parameter. Remember, the `actual_output` of your LLM application is always required for evaluation, while the `retrieval_context` and `tools_called` parameters are optional depending on the metrics you've enabled.

:::note
The json key path tells Confident AI where to look in your Json response for the respective test case parameter values.
:::

For instance, if you set the key path of the `actual_output` parameter to `["response", "actual output"]`, the correct Json response to return from your LLM endpoint is as follows:

```python
{
    "response": {
        "actual output": "must be a string!"
    }
}
```

That's not to say you can't include other things to return in your Json response, but the key path will determine the variables Confident AI will be using to populate `LLMTestCase`s at evaluation time.

:::info
If you're wondering why `expected_output`, `context`, and `expected_tools` is not required in setting up your json key path, it is because it is expected that these variables are static, just like the `input`, and should therefore come from your dataset instead.
