## September

September focused on smoother installs, richer telemetry, and big Synthesizer quality-of-life upgrades. Dependency constraints were relaxed (notably around `opentelemetry`, `grpcio`, and `opentelemetry-sdk`) alongside several version bumps, improving compatibility when used as a downstream dependency. Red-teaming and evaluation gained deeper observability and robustness, with span-based tracking, packaging/import cleanups, improved result handling, and new multimodal support via `MLLMTestCase` and VIEScore. The Synthesizer saw faster document-based context generation with async chunking and caching, better progress visibility with optional `tqdm`, quality scoring and filtering via `critic

- Fix sample code to include the missing `retrieval_context` variable so the “Let’s breakdown what happened” section runs as written and matches the surrounding explanation. ([#995](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/995)) <!-- pr:995 --> ([César García](https://github.com/elsatch))



## August

August focused on a major stabilization and API-polish push, culminating in the 1.0.0 release and subsequent rapid version updates. Observability and feedback workflows were streamlined with `monitor()` as the primary logging API (standardizing on `response_id`) and clearer guides for monitoring, tracing, and reviewer/user feedback via `send_feedback()`. Evaluation gained stronger multi-turn support and richer metrics, including new conversational messages, `ConversationCompletenessMetric`, improved tool correctness (exact and ordered matching), standardized `metrics_data` reporting, and parameter naming cleanups like `tools_used`/`tools_called`. Reliability and schema enforcement also saw a

## July

July focused on more reliable evaluation and tracing across LangChain and LlamaIndex, with new one-line integration helpers and more consistent, structured input/output capture to reduce missing fields. Synthetic data and red-teaming workflows saw a major usability pass, including new dataset helpers, async generation options, schema-enforced outputs via `schema=`, and clearer docs and renamed APIs around attacks, vulnerabilities, and evolution settings. Metrics and tooling improved with Pydantic-backed JSON outputs, better verbose logging via `verboseLogs`, the new `ToolCorrectnessMetric`, and prompt refinements for benchmarks like GSM8K and HumanEval. The release also included a steady set

### Backward Incompatible Change

#### v0.21.66
- Simplify feedback submission by removing the `provider` argument and returning less data from `send_feedback`, while still sending the same feedback payload. ([#879](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/879)) <!-- pr:879 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.21.63

#### v0.21.64
- Rename red-teaming enums and parameters for clearer intent: `RedTeamEvolution`/`Response` become `RTAdversarialAttack`/`RTVulnerability`, and `generate_red_teaming_goldens` now uses `attacks` and `vulnerabilities` (with updated defaults). ([#863](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/863)) <!-- pr:863 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))


### New Feature

#### v0.21.74

## June

June focused on making evaluations and synthetic data generation more robust, configurable, and easier to diagnose. Tracing and metrics got clearer typing/documentation, improved parsing and JSON-only `reason` handling, stronger error and retry visibility, and multiple fixes around metric state isolation and async reliability, including a later revert to restore instance-based state behavior. The Synthesizer advanced with new evolution capabilities via `evolve()`, broader guidance and options like `evolution_types`, a new Text-to-SQL use case, and support for custom embedding models through the `embedder` interface. Benchmarks gained an optional `dataset` hook for local/custom runs, and API/

### Bug Fix

#### v0.21.61
- Fix superclass initialization in `ragas.py` by switching from `super.__init__()` to `super().__init__()`. This prevents `TypeError` during metric construction and ensures base class setup runs before class-specific attributes. ([#848](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/848)) <!-- pr:848 --> ([Rishi](https://github.com/RishiSankineni))

#### v0.21.62
- Revert recent stateless metric behavior changes so metric state is stored on the metric instance again. This restores the previous async execution flow and defaults verbose output back to enabled. ([#850](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/850)) <!-- pr:850 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.21.60
- Fix dataset and benchmark parsing by consistently using `expected_output` and converting API response keys to snake_case, improving compatibility with camelCase payloads. ([#845](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/845)) <!-- pr:845 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.21.59
- Fix metric state initialization by moving `ContextVar` fields to `BaseMetric.__init__` and calling `super().__init__()` in metric constructors. This prevents state from being shared across metric classes and improves isolation when running multiple metrics. ([#841](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/841)) <!-- pr:841 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.21.56
- Fix the `TestResult` field name to use `metrics_metadata` consistently, improving compatibility for users accessing metric results programmatically. ([#832](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/832)) <!-- pr:832 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.21.57
- Fix BaseMetric state isolation by assigning new ContextVar instances per metric class, preventing score, reason, and error values from leaking across metrics in concurrent or multi-metric runs. ([#834](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/834)) <!-- pr:834 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.21.53
- Fix metric reason output to return a JSON `reason` value instead of raw model text. Prompts now request JSON-only responses and reason parsing trims/loads the JSON for more reliable `include_reason` results. ([#824](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/824)) <!-- pr:824 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.21.49
- Fix a typo in the Answer Correctness Metric guide by removing stray markup around the G-Eval reference. ([#804](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/804)) <!-- pr:804 --> ([Kritin Vongthongsri](https://github.com/kritinv))

#### v0.21.50
- Fix bias and toxicity metric prompt templates by formatting rubrics as JSON for more consistent model parsing. Improve metric runner error handling so `ignore_errors` reliably marks failing metrics as unsuccessful instead of crashing async runs. ([#811](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/811)) <!-- pr:811 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

Reduce overhead by avoiding repeated computation inside the scoring loop. ([#650](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/650)) <!-- pr:650 --> ([lplcor](https://github.com/Peilun-Li))



## March

March focused on making evaluations faster, clearer, and easier to automate, with major work on async execution, event-loop compatibility in notebooks, and more reliable concurrency controls via the `run_async` flag. Evaluation UX improved with a new progress indicator (and better toggles), richer and more consistent score metadata, and caching that reuses prior results safely without trampling metric configuration. The synthesizer and dataset tooling expanded significantly with new APIs for generating and exporting synthetic `Golden` test cases from contexts and documents, plus prompt evolution for more diverse inputs and improved reproducibility through saved prompt templates and hyperper-

### Backward Incompatible Change

#### v0.20.79
- Rename the hyperparameter decorator from `set_hyperparameters` to `log_hyperparameters` and update public exports and docs accordingly. ([#557](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/557)) <!-- pr:557 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))


### New Feature

#### v0.21.14
- Add optional logprob-based G-Eval scoring. If logprobs are unavailable or fail, it automatically falls back to the standard one-shot score. Relax Python version requirements to better support older runtimes. ([#619](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/619)) <!-- pr:619 --> ([lplcor](https://github.com/Peilun-Li))

#### v0.21.13

#### v0.20.79
- Add a new Synthesizer that generates synthetic `Golden` test cases from a list of context strings using an LLM prompt and JSON parsing, with support for pluggable embedding models via `DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel`. ([#533](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/533)) <!-- pr:533 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))
- Add a revamped synthesizer API to generate `Golden` examples from multiple contexts with optional multithreading and a `max_goldens_per_context` limit. Generated goldens can now be saved to CSV or JSON files for easier reuse and sharing. ([#553](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/553)) <!-- pr:553 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))
- Add `Dataset.generate_goldens()` to generate and append synthetic goldens from a synthesizer. Improve synthesizer UX by showing a progress spinner during generation and routing progress output to stderr. ([#554](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/554)) <!-- pr:554 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.78
- Add initial Big Bench Hard benchmark support with task selection, dataset loading from Hugging Face, and exact-match scoring for model predictions. ([#548](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/548)) <!-- pr:548 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))
- Add support for capturing and exporting the user prompt template alongside the model and hyperparameters in test run metadata, enabling easier reproduction and debugging of evaluation runs. ([#551](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/551)) <!-- pr:551 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))


### Experimental Feature

#### v0.21.01

### Bug Fix

#### v0.21.14
- Improve G-Eval scoring by safely handling logprob-based responses and falling back to standard generation when logprobs are unavailable or parsing fails. This reduces evaluation failures across models that don’t support logprobs. ([#644](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/644)) <!-- pr:644 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.21.13
- Fix a typo in `generate_goldens_from_docs` by renaming the `docuemnt_paths` argument to `document_paths` for clearer and consistent usage. ([#639](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/639)) <!-- pr:639 --> ([eLafo](https://github.com/eLafo))

#### v0.21.01
- Fix RAGAS metrics to accept either a model name string or a prebuilt chat model instance. This prevents incorrect model wrapping and ensures the provided model is used when running evaluations, including in async measurement paths. ([#630](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/630)) <!-- pr:630 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.21.12
- Fix multiprocessing issues when using cached test runs by ensuring the current test run is loaded before appending results and by disabling cache writes when not running under the tool. This prevents missing or corrupted run data in parallel executions. ([#633](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/633)) <!-- pr:633 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.21.00
- Fix errors when sending large test runs by batching test case uploads and reporting incomplete uploads with a clearer message. Also record total passed/failed counts for the run so results are summarized reliably. ([#621](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/621)) <!-- pr:621 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.98
- Fix a typo in the G-Eval results prompt so it now reads "the evaluation steps" instead of "th evaluation steps". ([#612](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/612)) <!-- pr:612 --> ([lplcor](https://github.com/Peilun-Li))
- Fix metric score output to use consistent metric names and a single `metricsScores` structure, removing the legacy `metricScores` field. This prevents mismatched keys and simplifies downstream parsing of test run results. ([#614](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/614)) <!-- pr:614 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.93
- Fix noisy console output during test run wrap-up by removing an unintended print of metrics scores. ([#603](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/603)) <!-- pr:603 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.91
- Fix JSON serialization for older Pydantic versions by falling back to `dict()` when `model_dump()` is unavailable, preventing errors when pushing datasets or saving test runs. ([#600](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/600)) <!-- pr:600 --> ([Vaibhav Kubre](https://github.com/kubre))

#### v0.20.89
- Fix G-Eval to reuse provided `evaluation_steps` instead of regenerating them. Improve evaluation prompt instructions to avoid quoting the score in the reason. Also clarify the init error message when neither `criteria` nor `evaluation_steps` is provided. ([#590](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/590)) <!-- pr:590 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.87
- Fix synthesizer model calls to use `model.generate()` so text evolution and synthetic data generation work with models that don’t support direct invocation. ([#585](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/585)) <!-- pr:585 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.82
- Fix `strict_mode` behavior for the hallucination metric so it uses a zero threshold for stricter evaluation, instead of incorrectly forcing a threshold of 1. ([#567](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/567)) <!-- pr:567 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))
- Fix async execution controls by renaming the `asynchronous` flag to `run_async` across evaluation and metrics, ensuring metrics run with the intended sync/async behavior and clearer error messages when async isn’t supported. ([#572](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/572)) <!-- pr:572 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))
- Fix LlamaIndex async evaluators to await metric execution by using `a_measure`, preventing missed async work and making evaluation results more reliable. ([#575](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/575)) <!-- pr:575 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.83
- Fix async evaluation and metric `async_mode` execution by reusing or creating an event loop instead of calling `asyncio.run`, preventing failures when a loop is already running or closed. ([#577](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/577)) <!-- pr:577 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.85
- Fix indicator toggle behavior by setting `DISABLE_DEEPEVAL_INDICATOR` consistently based on `show_indicator`, so the indicator can be re-enabled after being disabled. ([#582](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/582)) <!-- pr:582 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.79
- Fix knowledge retention evaluation to use the current message fields (`input` and `actual_output`) when generating verdicts and extracting knowledge, preventing mismatched or empty prompts in conversational test cases. ([#555](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/555)) <!-- pr:555 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.78
- Fix summarization coverage scoring so the score is calculated only from questions where the original verdict is `yes`. This prevents incorrect results when non-applicable questions were previously included in the denominator. ([#550](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/550)) <!-- pr:550 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))



## February

February focused on making evaluations more reliable, faster, and easier to integrate as the metrics and template layout was reorganized into clearer per-metric modules while preserving key imports like `HallucinationMetric`. Multiple core metrics saw meaningful upgrades, including improved faithfulness, answer relevancy, hallucination, summarization, and knowledge retention with better prompt parsing, clearer verdict rules, optional multithreading, and more consistent reasoning outputs. Integrations and tooling were refined with safer defaults and compatibility updates for Hugging Face, LlamaIndex, and RAGAS, alongside stricter type validation, improved JSON error messages, and a more CI-vi

## January

January focused on making evaluations faster, clearer, and easier to integrate across common LLM stacks. Event tracking now runs in the background by default with a synchronous option when needed, while telemetry and CLI output were refined with safer Sentry setup and transient spinner-based progress on stderr. Metrics and results reporting saw major consistency upgrades, including dynamic per-metric thresholds, explicit `success` flags, evaluation-model metadata in outputs, and new performance assertions via `LatencyMetric` and `CostMetric`. Integrations and APIs matured with improved LangChain and Azure OpenAI compatibility, expanded LlamaIndex tracing and evaluator wrappers, Hugging Face/

### Bug Fix

#### v0.20.55
- Fix package setup so the `integrations` module is included in source and wheel distributions. This prevents missing `deepeval.integrations` files after installing from PyPI. ([#447](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/447)) <!-- pr:447 --> ([Yves Junqueira](https://github.com/nictuku))

#### v0.20.56
- Fix `CostMetric` and `LatencyMetric` to use clearer `max_cost` and `max_latency` constructor arguments instead of `threshold`, and update docs and tests to match. This makes performance limits easier to configure consistently. ([#451](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/451)) <!-- pr:451 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.54
- Improve optional dependency handling by conditionally importing `transformers` and `sentence_transformers` integrations. This prevents import-time failures when those libraries aren’t installed and surfaces a clear error only when the related callbacks or metrics are used. ([#438](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/438)) <!-- pr:438 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.52
- Fix `EvaluationDataset` using shared mutable default lists for `goldens` and `test_cases`, which could leak entries across instances. New datasets now start with fresh empty lists when not provided. ([#431](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/431)) <!-- pr:431 --> ([jeffometer](https://github.com/jeffometer))

#### v0.20.51

#### v0.20.50
- Fix API key detection by checking stored credentials instead of relying on a local `.deepeval` file, preventing push/pull and test-run uploads from failing when the file is missing. ([#422](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/422)) <!-- pr:422 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.49
- Fix `ContextualPrecisionMetric` validation to reject missing `actual_output`, and clarify the error message and docs to list `actual_output` as a required `LLMTestCase` field. ([#413](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/413)) <!-- pr:413 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))
- Fix event tracking by removing stray debug prints and improving handling of non-JSON API responses to avoid unexpected errors during requests. ([#416](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/416)) <!-- pr:416 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))
- Fix division-by-zero errors in several evaluation metrics by returning a score of 0 when there are no verdicts, no relevant nodes, or no context sentences. ([#419](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/419)) <!-- pr:419 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.45
- Fix Azure OpenAI support in the LangChain integration by switching to `langchain_openai` and passing `model_version` directly (defaulting to an empty string when unset). This prevents Azure model initialization failures due to outdated imports or missing version handling. ([#401](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/401)) <!-- pr:401 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))

#### v0.20.46
- Fix results table pass/fail display by using each metric's `success` flag instead of comparing score to threshold, so custom metrics report accurately. ([#404](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/pull/404)) <!-- pr:404 --> ([Jeffrey Ip](https://github.com/penguine-ip))
