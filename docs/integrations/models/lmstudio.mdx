`deepeval` supports running evaluations using local LLMs that expose OpenAI-compatible APIs. One such provider is **LM Studio**, a user-friendly desktop app for running models locally.

### Command Line

To start using LM Studio with `deepeval`, follow these steps:

1. Make sure LM Studio is running. The typical base URL for LM Studio is: `http://localhost:1234/v1/`.
2. Run the following command in your terminal to connect `deepeval` to LM Studio:

```bash
deepeval set-local-model --prompt-api-key \
    --model=<model_name> \
    --base-url="http://localhost:1234/v1/"
```

:::tip
If your local endpoint doesn't require authentication enter any placeholder string when prompted to enter an api key.

:::tip Persisting settings
You can persist CLI settings with the optional `--save` flag.
See [Flags and Configs -> Persisting CLI settings](/docs/evaluation-flags-and-configs#persisting-cli-settings-with---save).

### Reverting to OpenAI

To switch back to using OpenAI’s hosted models, run:

```bash
deepeval unset-local-model
```
