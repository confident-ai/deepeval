`deepeval` supports running evaluations using local LLMs that expose OpenAI-compatible APIs. One such provider is **LM Studio**, a user-friendly desktop app for running models locally.

### Command Line

To start using LM Studio with `deepeval`, follow these steps:

1. Make sure LM Studio is running. The typical base URL for LM Studio is: `http://localhost:1234/v1/`.
2. Run the following command in your terminal to connect `deepeval` to LM Studio:

```bash
deepeval set-local-model --model-name=<model_name> \
    --base-url="http://localhost:1234/v1/" \
    --api-key=<api-key>
```

:::tip
Use any placeholder string for `--api-key` if your local endpoint doesn't require authentication.
:::

### Reverting to OpenAI

To switch back to using OpenAI’s hosted models, run:

```bash
deepeval unset-local-model
```
