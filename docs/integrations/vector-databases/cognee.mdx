## Quick Summary

Cognee is an open-source framework for anyone to easily implement graph RAG into their LLM application. You can learn more by visiting their [website here.](https://www.cognee.ai/)

:::info
With Cognee, you should see an increase in your [`ContextualRelevancyMetric`](/docs/metrics-contextual-relevancy), [`ContextualRecallMetric`](/docs/metrics-contextual-recall), and [`ContextualPrecisionMetric`](/docs/metrics-contextual-precision) scores.
:::

Unlike traditional vector databases that relies on simple embedding retrieval and re-rankings to retrieve `retrieval_context`s, Cognee stores and creates a "semantic graph" out of your data, which allows for more accurate retrievals.

## Setup Cognee

Simply add your LLM API key to the environment variables:

```console
import os
os.environ["LLM_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

For those on Networkx, you can also create an account on Graphistry to visualize results:

```python
import cognee

cognee.config.set_graphistry_config({
    "username": "YOUR_USERNAME",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
})
```

Finally, ingest your data into Cognee and run some retrievals:

```python
from cognee.api.v1.search import SearchType

...
text = "Cognee is the Graph RAG Framework"
await cognee.add(text) # add a new piece of information
await cognee.cognify() # create a semantic graph using cognee

retrieval_context = await cognee.search(SearchType.INSIGHTS, query_text="What is Cognee?")
for context in retrieval_context:
    print(context)
```

## Evaluating Cognee RAG Pipelines

Unit testing RAG pipelines powered by Cognee is as simple as defining an `EvaluationDataset` and generating `actual_output`s and `retrieval_context`s at evaluation time. Building upon the previous example, first generate all the necessarily parameters required to test RAG:

```python main.py
...

input = "What is Cognee?"
retrieval_context = await cognee.search(SearchType.INSIGHTS, query_text="What is Cognee?")

prompt = """
Answer the user question based on the supporting context

User Question:
{input}

Supporting Context:
{retrieval_context}
"""

actual_output = generate(prompt) # hypothetical function, replace with your own LLM
```

Then, simply run `evaluate()`:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import (
    ContextualRecallMetric,
    ContextualPrecisionMetric,
    ContextualRelevancyMetric,
)
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval import evaluate

...
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input=input,
    actual_output=actual_output,
    retrieval_context=retrieval_context,
    expected_output="Cognee is the Graph RAG Framework.",
)
evaluate(
    [test_case],
    metrics=[
        ContextualRecallMetric(),
        ContextualPrecisionMetric(),
        ContextualRelevancyMetric(),
    ],
)
```

That's it! Do you notice an increase in the contextual metric scores?
