In the previous section, we successfully passed all test cases and generated summaries that aligned with our evaluation on a set of five documents. However, five documents are **insufficient for a robust evaluation**. To ensure reliability, you'll need to maintain a larger dataset.

## Creating a Dataset

You can easily create a dataset on Confident AI from a test run you've already completed, and start building from the dataset of the five documents we ran evaluations on. This means creating a dataset is as simple as a clicking _save as new dataset_ and giving it a unique name.

You can also create a dataset by uploading a CSV file or by creating goldens from scratch. `Goldens` are test cases `where` actual_outputs haven't been populated yet. They make up the golden dataset, and you can [learn more about them here](/docs/evaluation-datasets#with-goldens).

    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "20px",
  }}

</div>

You'll notice that only the inputs corresponding to your document texts are populated. This allows you to generate different summaries (`actual_output`) for each iteration of your summarizer.

## Maintaining the Dataset

Building a dataset is no easy task, especially if you're building a domain-specific legal document summarizer. Very likely, you'll be adding reference metrics (metrics that require a ground truth `expected_output`), which means you'll need legal experts to populate what constitutes an ideal summary.

:::tip
Your domain experts can use Confident AI to **add, edit, annotate, and comment** on test cases while building them, as well as mark whether each test case is finalized and ready for evaluation.

Once you have a complete dataset of documents, you can pull it into your code with just two lines to run evaluations, which we'll be doing in the next section.
