In the previous section of this tutorial we've built a `RAGAgent` that:

- Retrieves documents related to a query from our knowledge base
- Generates natural sounding answers to the query from the retrieved context

To evaluate a RAG QA Agent, we'll use single-turn [`LLMTestCase`](https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-test-casess)s from `deepeval`. We need to provide the `retrieval_context` in our test cases for evaluating our RAG application.

![Single-turn LLM Test Case](https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/docs:llm-test-case.png)

Our RAG agent first retrieves context from our knowledge base and uses the retrieved context to answer the question. All these questions are individual interactions that only depend on the retrieved context. Hence, we'll create our test cases with `input`, `actual_output` and `retrieval_context` as shown below:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="...", # Your transcript
    actual_output="...", # The summary or action items
    retrieval_context="..." # Your retrieved context
)
```

When evaluating RAG based applications, **you don't want to evaluate it on a random set of queries.** You will have to create questions and queries that test the RAG application's abilities on edge cases that are in and outside your knowledge base.

## Setup Testing Enviroment

There are 2 primary approaches to evaluating RAG based applications. They are:

1. **Using Historical Data** - You can pull datasets that contain previous queries or input queries that are frequently asked to your RAG agent.

2. **Generate question-answer pairs** - You can generate synthetic question-answer pairs from your knowledge base using AI.

Option 2 is the most recommended approach as it creates a ground truth for you to evaluate your RAG agent on. Creating synthetic data also allows you to create question-answer pairs on edge cases that you would never think of otherwise. While this approach is recommended we will still go through the other option quickly:

### Use Historical Data

If you have queries and inputs stored in your database, you can convert them to `LLMTestCase` objects:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Example: Fetch queries and responses from your database
queries = fetch_queries_from_db()  # Your database query here

test_cases = []
for query in queries:
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=query["input"],
        actual_output=query["response"],
        retrieval_context=query["context"]
    )
    test_cases.append(test_case)

print(test_cases)
```

This method is the quickest because the data already exists, however it might not be feasible becuase you may or may not store the retrieval context in your database. It also provides insights from the pevious knowledge base and does not represent your current RAG agent's capabilities.

### Generate QA Pairs

It is highly recommended to generate synthetic question-answer pairs using `deepeval`'s [`Synthesizer`](https://deepeval.com/docs/synthesizer-introduction). Because this allows you to:

- Generate question answer pairs that test your RAG application on edge cases
- Create a dataset with these question pairs that allow you to use them anytime and anywhere

You can create `Golden`s of question-answer pairs by using `deepeval`'s [`Synthesizer`](https://deepeval.com/docs/synthesizer-introduction). Here's how you can use the synthesizer:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()

goldens = synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_docs(
    # Provide the path to your documents
    document_paths=['theranos_legacy.txt', 'theranos_legacy.docx', 'theranos_legacy.pdf']
)
```

This above code snippet returns a list of `Golden`s, that contain `input` and `expected_output`. We can use these goldens to create `LLMTestCase`s by calling our RAG QA agent. Before that we can store these goldens in a dataset to be able to use these goldens anywhere and anytime.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click here to learn about <code>Golden</code> in DeepEval</strong></summary>

A dataset can only be created with a list of goldens. `Golden`s represent a more flexible alternative to test cases in the `deepeval`, and **it is the preferred way to initialize a dataset using goldens**. Unlike test cases, `Golden`s:

- Don't require an `actual_output` when created
- Store expected results like `expected_output` and `expected_tools`
- Serve as templates before becoming fully-formed test cases

</details>

We can use the above created goldens to initialize a dataset and store it in cloud. Here's how you can do that:

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

dataset = EvaluationDataset(goldens=goldens)
dataset.push(alias="RAG QA Agent Dataset")
```

✅ Done. We can now move on to creating test cases using this dataset.

For RAG applications, it is recommended to evaluate your application on a component level for retriever, generator and as a whole RAG too.

### Creating Test Cases

We will now use our RAG QA agent on the dataset to generate some `LLMTestCase`s that we can use to evaluate our agent. We will create them using the `input`s in goldens of our dataset and the agent's responses as `actual_output`s.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset
from rag_qa_agent import RAGAgent # Import your RAG Agent here

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.pull("RAG QA Agent Dataset")
agent = RAGAgent()

test_cases = []
for golden in dataset.goldens:
    retrieved_docs = agent.retrieve(golden.input)
    response = agent.generate(golden.input, retrieved_docs)
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=golden.input,
        actual_output=str(response),
        retrieval_context=retrieved_docs,
        expected_output=golden.expected_output
    )
    test_cases.append(test_case)

print(len(test_cases))
```

✅ Done. We can now move on to creating metrics for evaluating our RAG on a component level and as a whole.

## Creating Your Metrics

Here are the metrics and evaluation criteria we'll be using to evaluate our RAG application.

### Retriever Metrics

For a **retriever** `deepeval` provides 3 metrics to evaluate the quality of the retrieved context. Here are the metrics and the criteria they evaluate on:

1. [Contextual Relevancy](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-contextual-relevancy) — _The retrieved context must be relevant to the query_
2. [Contextual Recall](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-contextual-recall) — _The retrieved context should be enough to answer the query_
3. [Contextual Precision](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-contextual-precision) — _The retrieved context should be precise and must not include unnecessary details_

Here's how you can create these metrics:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import (
    ContextualRelevancyMetric,
    ContextualRecallMetric,
    ContextualPrecisionMetric,
)

relevancy = ContextualRelevancyMetric()
recall = ContextualRecallMetric()
precision = ContextualPrecisionMetric()
```

### Generator Metrics

For a **generator**, we will have to define criteria based on the use case, in our case the QA agent will respond to us in `json` format, and hence we will be using a custom metric to evaluate the following criteria:

1. [Answer Correctness](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals) — To evaluate only the answer from our `json`.
2. [Citation Accuracy](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals) — To evaluate the citations mentioned in the `json`.

These are custom criteria so we'll be using `GEval` metric to create these metrics. Here's how we will initialize our generator metrics:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import GEval

answer_correctness = GEval(
    name="Answer Correctness",
    criteria="Evaluate if the actual output's 'answer' property is correct and complete from the input and retrieved context. If the answer is not correct or complete, reduce score."
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.RETRIEVAL_CONTEXT]
)

citation_accuracy = GEval(
    name="Citation Accuracy",
    criteria="Check if the citations in the actual output are correct and relevant based on input and retrieved context. If they're not correct, reduce score."
    evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.RETRIEVAL_CONTEXT]
)
```

We can now use the test cases and metrics we've created to run evaluations on our RAG agent.

## Running Your First Evals

We will do separate evaluations for our retriever and generator. Here's how we can do that:

### Retriever Evaluation

Now we can use the goldens we just created to evaluate the retriever. Here's how we can evaluate our retriever using the _relevancy, recall and precision_ metrics that we've defined above:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate

retriever_metrics = [relevancy, recall, precision]

evaluate(test_cases, retriever_metrics)
```

### Generator Evaluation

We can use the exact same goldens to evaluate our generator by using the generator metrics we've defined above. Here's how we can evaluate the generator:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate

generator_metrics = [answer_correctness, citation_accuracy]

evaluate(test_cases, generator_metrics)
```

🎉🥳 **Congratulations!** You've successfully learnt how to:

- Create test cases during run time using datasets
- Run evaluations on the test cases using `deepeval`

:::note
If you remember the implementation of our RAG agent. There are too many hyperparameters that can change the behavious of our RAG application. Click here to see the [implementation of RAG Agent](https://deepeval.com/tutorials/rag-qa-agent/tutorial-rag-qa-development) once again.

In the next section, we'll see how we can improve the performance of our RAG agent by tweaking hyperparameters and using the evaluation results.
