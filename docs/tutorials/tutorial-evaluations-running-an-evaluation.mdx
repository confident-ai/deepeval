With our metrics in place, we’re finally ready to **run our first evaluation**. Using the five input-response pairs we reviewed from the previous section, we’ll construct a dataset, evaluate it using the 3 metrics we defined, and analyze the results on Confident AI.

## Creating Your Dataset

The first step is to create a dataset that contains the 5 previous input-response pairs as `LLMTestCase`s.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# test cases truncated for better readability...
test_case_0 = LLMTestCase(
  input="Hey, I've been experiencing headaches lately.",
  actual_output="I can help you with that.  Could you pleas...",
  retrieval_context=["Headaches can have various causes, in..."]
)

test_case_1 = LLMTestCase(
  input="I'm been coughing a lot lately.",
  actual_output="Could you please provide your name, the da..."
)

test_case_2 = LLMTestCase(
  input="I'm feeling pretty sick, can I book an appointment...",
  actual_output="Could you please provide more specific det..."
)

test_case_3 = LLMTestCase(
  input="My name is John Doe. My email is johndoe@gmail.com...",
  actual_output="Please confirm the following details: Name..."
)

test_case_4 = LLMTestCase(
  input="My nose has been running constantly. Could it be s...",
  actual_output="A runny nose is always caused by harmless ...",
  retrieval_context=["A runny nose can be caused by common ..."]
)
```

Although we've precomputed the `actual_output` and the `retrieval_context` for each of the test cases in example above, you'll ideally generate these parameters from your LLM application at evaluation time.

:::note
The parameters we need to populate `LLMTestCase`s with depend on the metrics we’ve chosen and what parameters they require. The _union of those required parameters_ is what we must define for each `LLMTestCase`. You can find the `LLMTestCase` parameters required for each metric in their respective metric documentation pages:

- [`AnswerRelevancyMetric`](/docs/metrics-answer-relevancy#required-arguments)
- [`FaithfulnessMetric`](/docs/metrics-faithfulness#required-arguments)
- [`GEval`](/docs/metrics-llm-evals#required-arguments) (for professionalism)

However, you'll notice that although the `FaithfulnessMetric` requires `retrieval_context`, some `LLMTestCase`s simply does not have one. This could be because for some LLM interaction there requires no `retrieval_context`, and in that case, you should leave it out and not provide an empty list. While under normal circumstances this will cause the metric to error during evaluation, you'll learn in later sections that you can actually set the `skip_on_missing_params` argument to `True` to not run metrics on `LLMTestCase` where the required parameters are missing during evaluation:

```python
...

evaluate(..., skip_on_missing_params=True)
```

:::

Finally, we'll define an `EvaluationDataset` to group together the collection of `LLMTestCase`s we've defined.

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

...
dataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[test_case_0, test_case_1, test_case_2, test_case_3, test_case_4])
```

## Running An Evaluation

With our dataset and metrics ready, we can begin **running our first evaluation**. Import the `evaluate()` function from DeepEval and provide your dataset and metrics in the appropriate fields. Optionally, you can also log your LLM application's hyperparameters, which will be extremely important for optimizing them in future iterations.

```python
from deepeval import evaluate

...
evaluate(
  dataset,
  metrics=[answer_relevancy_metric, faithfulness_metric, professionalism_metric],
  skip_on_missing_params=True,
  hyperparameters={"model": MODEL, "prompt template": SYSTEM_PROMPT, "temperature": TEMPERATURE}
)
```

You can should definitely learn more about the ways in which you can customize the `evaluate()` function [here.](/docs/evaluation-introduction#evaluating-without-pytest)

:::tip
If you don't know where the metrics are coming from, you should go back and revisit [this section on defining metrics in `deepeval`](/tutorials/tutorial-metrics-selection#defining-metrics-in-deepeval). Similarly, if you don't know where `MODEL`, `SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and `TEMPERATRE` are coming from, revisit [this section.](/tutorials/tutorial-llm-application-example#defining-your-hyperparameters)

## Analyzing Your Testing Report

You'll be redirected to the following page on Confident AI **once your evaluation is complete**. Here, you'll find the testing report generated for the 5 test cases that we defined and evaluated in the previous steps. Each test case displays its status (pass or fail), input, and corresponding actual output. Clicking on a test case will reveal the remaining parameters and metric scores.

:::info
A test case is only **considered passing** if it exceeds the threshold for all the metrics it was evaluated on.
:::

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_evaluation_01.png"
    style={{
      marginTop: "20px",
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

You can clearly see that while 2 of our test cases passed, 3 failed. In the next steps, we'll be going through each result, test case by test case, to understand **what caused them to fail**, which will help us make the relevant and necessary improvements to our LLM application in subsequent sections.

### First Test Case

Here, you can see that our first test case **excels across all metrics**, achieving perfect scores in Answer Relevancy and Faithfulness, and scoring 0.93 in Professionalism. Since nothing is failing, we don't need to inspect this test case further.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_evaluation_02.png"
    style={{
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

### Second Test Case

On the other hand, the second test case passes the faithfulness and professionalism but **scores a 0 for Answer Relevancy**, which aligns with the expectations we've set for this particular test case when we [defined our evaluation criteria](/tutorials/tutorial-metrics-evaluation-criteria).

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_evaluation_03.png"
    style={{
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

To further analyze the metric scores, click on the inspect icon located at the top right-hand corner of each test case.

:::tip
Confident AI makes it easy to analyze metric scores by offering **clear reasons** for why each metric score failed or succeeded, along with **detailed verbose logs** for visibility into how each score was calculated.
:::

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_evaluation_04.png"
    style={{
      marginTop: "20px",
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

The reason also aligns with our expectations, since the test case is failing because the output contains irrelevant information about appointment details, which does not address the concern about coughing.

### Third Test Case

Similar to the first test case, the third test case passes all the metrics with near-perfect scores, so we won't be needing to inspect this test case further.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_evaluation_05.png"
    style={{
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

### Fourth Test Case

The 4th test case narrowly failed Professionalism with a score of 0.61, while narrowly passing Answer Relevancy with a score of 0.71.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_evaluation_06.png"
    style={{
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

Test cases with borderline metric scores **require extra attention**, as they tread a fine line between acceptable and unacceptable performance. Careful consideration is needed to determine whether adjustment in the LLM is necessary, as it could potentially impact other areas of your application that you don't know about.

:::tip
Analyzing borderline test cases in a CSV or JSON file can be exhausting and tedious. Fortunately, Confident AI simplifies this process by allowing you to **filter by metric scores and score ranges**, making it easy to identify the test cases you care about.
:::

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_evaluation_065.png"
    style={{
      marginTop: "20px",
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

Let's analyze why **Professionalism is failing**. The provided reason states that while the language is clear and uses appropriate medical terms, it lacks empathy and support in its tone, which is inconsistent with professional medical norms.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_evaluation_07.png"
    style={{
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

### Fifth Test Case

Finally, let's examine the 5th and final test case, which fails all 3 metrics.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_evaluation_08.png"
    style={{
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

Inspecting Answer Relevancy reveals that the response includes multiple irrelevant statements and fails to address the seriousness of a constantly runny nose, which was the primary focus of the input.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_evaluation_09.png"
    style={{
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

Analyzing Professionalism and Contextual Relevance shows that Professionalism fails because the response is overly simplistic and dismissive of potential concerns. Faithfulness fails because the output incorrectly claims that a runny nose is only caused by non-serious conditions, failing to acknowledge more serious possibilities like CSF leaks or chronic sinusitis.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://deepeval-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_evaluation_10.png"
    style={{
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

## Summary

Our evaluation results revealed failures in test cases 2, 4, and 5, highlighting areas that need targeted enhancements to improve the LLM’s accuracy, tone, and contextual understanding.

- **Second test case**: Failed **Answer Relevancy** because the response included irrelevant details, such as appointment information, rather than addressing the primary concern about coughing. To improve, the LLM’s context-awareness should better prioritize user intent and exclude extraneous information.
- **Fourth test case**: Failed **Professionalism** due to an overly simplistic and dismissive tone. It also narrowly passed **Answer Relevancy** with a borderline score. Improvements should focus on refining the tone to ensure empathetic, professional responses and enhancing content prioritization to align more effectively with queries.
- **Fifth test case**: Failed **Answer Relevancy**, **Professionalism**, and **Faithfulness**. The response included irrelevant statements, was dismissive of serious concerns, and contained factual inaccuracies, such as failing to acknowledge serious conditions like CSF leaks. Fixes require strengthening factual accuracy, improving context parsing, and refining tone calibration.

By addressing these failures and adjusting the relevant hyperparameters, our medical chatbot can deliver more accurate, empathetic, and contextually aligned responses, ensuring better performance and user satisfaction.
