With our metrics chosen, we can finally begin running evaluations. In order to do so, we'll need to **construct a dataset** with the documents we want to summarize and generate summaries for them using our LLM summarizer. This will allow us to directly apply our metrics to the dataset when running evaluations.

:::caution important
You'll want to login to Confident AI before running an evaluation to **save our evaluation results** and easily **analyze them** in a report format.

```python
deepeval login
```

:::

## Constructing a Dataset

If you're building a document summarizer, you may have already have a folder of **documents or PDFs** waiting to be summarized. If that's the case, you'll first want to parse these PDFs into strings that can be passed into your LLM summarizer. Here's how you can do that using `PyPDF2`.

```python
import os
import PyPDF2

def extract_text(pdf_path):
    """Extract text from a PDF file."""
    with open(pdf_path, "rb") as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
        text = "\n".join(page.extract_text() for page in reader.pages if page.extract_text())
    return text

# Replace with your folder containing PDFs
pdf_folder = "path/to/pdf/folder"
documents = []  # List to store extracted document strings

# Iterate over PDF files in the folder
for pdf_file in os.listdir(pdf_folder):
    if pdf_file.endswith(".pdf"):
        pdf_path = os.path.join(pdf_folder, pdf_file)
        document_text = extract_text(pdf_path)
        documents.append(document_text)  # Store extracted text
```

Next, you'll need to pass these documents into your legal document summarizer `llm.summarize()` and generate the summaries for each of them.

```python
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset
from some_llm_library import llm  # Replace with the actual LLM summarizer

# Convert document strings to test cases with LLM summaries
test_cases = [LLMTestCase(input=doc, actual_output=llm.summarize(doc)) for doc in documents]

# Create the evaluation dataset
dataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=test_cases)
```

:::info
An `EvaluationDataset` consists of a series of test cases. Each test case contains an `input`, which represents the document we feed into the summarizer, and the `actual_output`, which is the summary generated by the LLM. [More on test cases here](/docs/evaluation-test-cases).
:::

Keep in mind that, for the sake of this tutorial, our `EvaluationDataset` consists of 5 test cases (5 documents), and our first `test_case` corresponds to the service agreement we inspected when we first [defined our evaluation criteria](legal-doc-summarizer-defining-a-summarization-criteria) in the previous sections.

```python
print(dataset.test_cases[0].input)
#CONTRACT FOR SERVICES...
print(dataset.test_cases[0].actual_output)
#This agreement establishes...
print(len(dataset.test_cases))
# 5
```

With that, let's begin running our first evaluation.

## Running an Evaluation

To run an evaluation, first login to Confident AI.

```
deepeval login
```

Then, pass the concision and completeness metrics we defined in the [previous section](legal-doc-summarizer-selecting-your-metrics) along with the dataset we just created into the `evaluate` function.

```python
from deepeval.evaluate

evaluate(dataset, metrics=[concision_metric, completeness_metric])
```

:::tip
The `evaluate` function offers flexible customization for how you want to run evaluations, such as allowing you to control concurrency for asynchronous operations or manage error handling in different ways. You can [learn more about these options here](#).
:::

## Analyzing your Test Report

Once your evaluation is complete, you'll be redirected to the test cases page on Confident AI, which will display the evaluation report for the 5 document summaries we generated.

:::info
Each **test case** includes a status (pass or fail), input (document), and actual output (summary). A test case is considered failing if any one of its metric score fails to meet the metric threshold.
:::

### Identifying the Failing Test Case

As shown below, only **one of five summaries we generated failed to pass**. A further inspection reveals that the failing test case was indeed the very first summary we generated when we defined our evaluation criteria. More specifically, while the summary achieved a concision score 0.77, the completeness score did not meet the threshold, falling below the 0.5 requirement.

You can easily investigate why the summary failed to score above the passing threshold for the completeness metric by clicking on the `view test case details` button. This will show you the **reason, which was generated automatically during evaluation**.

```
The output captures the primary parties, service arrangement,
compensation, confidentiality, intellectual property, dispute
resolution, and force majeure, but omits exact payment terms
and governing law specifics, and does not detail service
expectations or warranty periods.
```

According to the reason, this particular test case is failing because the summary missed details on exact payment terms, which was a key detail in the original document. This failure is unacceptable, since we previously established that our summarizer could not afford to make such mistakes.

:::note
In the next section, we'll **iterate on our summarizer's hyperparameters** to improve the completeness factor in the summaries it generates, ensuring it meets this Completeness Metric's required passing threshold in our next evaluation.
