**DeepEval** is a powerful open-source LLM evaluation framework. In these tutorials we'll show you how you can use DeepEval to improve your LLM application one step at a time. These tutorials walk you through the process of evaluating and testing your LLM applications — from initial development to post-production.

Below is a curated set of tutorials — each focused on real-world tasks, metrics, and best practices for reliable LLM evaluation. Start with the basics, or jump straight to your use case.

## What You'll Learn

DeepEval tutorials cover the best practices for evaluating LLM applications across both development and production.

### Development Evals

You'll learn how to:

- Select evaluation metrics that align with your task
- Use `deepeval` to measure and track LLM performance
- Interpret results to tune prompts, models, and other system hyperparameters
- Scale evaluations to cover diverse inputs and edge cases

### Production Evals

You'll also see how to:

- Continuously evaluate your LLM's performance in production
- Run A/B tests on different models or configurations using real data
- Feed production insights back into your development workflow to improve future releases

LLM evaluation isn't a one-time step — it's a continuous loop. Production data sharpens development. Development precision strengthens production. Which is why it's crucial to do both — and DeepEval helps you do just that.

<summary><strong>Here are a few key terminologies to keep in mind for LLM evaluations</strong></summary>

- **Hyperparameters**: The configuration values that shape your LLM application. This includes system prompts, user prompts, model choice, temperature, chunk size (for RAG), and more.
- **System Prompt**: A prompt that defines the overall behavior of your LLM across all interactions.
- **Generation Model**: The model used to generate responses — this is the LLM you're evaluating. Throughout the tutorials, we'll simply call it the *model*.
- **Evaluation Model**: A separate LLM used to score, critique, or assess the outputs of your generation model. This is **not** the model being evaluated.

## What DeepEval Offers

DeepEval supports a wide range of LLM evaluation metrics tailored to different use cases, including:

- **RAG applications (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- **Conversational applications**
- **Agentic applications**

[Click here](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-introduction) to explore all the metrics `deepeval` offers.

Throughout these tutorials, we'll walk through how to evaluate a variety of use cases with `deepeval` using real-world best practices. Your specific use case may differ — and that's expected. 
The evaluation approach remains the same: **define your criteria, choose the right metrics, and iterate based on the results.**

## Who This Is For

Whether you're building chatbots, summarizers, or agent systems powered by LLMs, these tutorials are designed for:

- Developers shipping LLM features in real products
- Researchers testing prompts or model variations
- Teams optimizing LLM outputs at scale

Whether you're just experimenting or managing LLMs in production, these tutorials will help you test reliably, iterate faster, and ship with more confidence.
