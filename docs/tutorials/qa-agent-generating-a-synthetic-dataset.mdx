title: Generating a Comprehensive Synthetic Dataset from your Knowledge Base
sidebar_label: Generating Synthetic Datasets
---

In this section, we'll be generating a synthetic dataset from a text file containing information about MadeUpCompany, the company of interest, and its core product offerings. The goal is to create a dataset containing a **wide variety questions that users might potentially ask**.

:::tip
In QA use cases, synthetic datasets are often superior to human-curated evaluation datasets because they are more diverse and capture more edge cases, especially when using various evolution techniques. They can also be generated much more quickly.
:::

### Generating a Synthetic Dataset

Generating a dataset in `DeepEval` is simple. Simply create an `EvaluationDataset` and call the `synthesize` method with the documents in you knowledge base. In this example, we'll pass a single `.txt` file, but you can include multiple documents in `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` format.

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.generate_goldens_from_docs(document_paths=["madeup_company.txt"])
```

:::info
By default the synthesizer requires an OpenAI API key for generation. However, you can fully **customize the synthetic generation process** with custom models and various parameters. You can learn more about the [synthetic generation process here](/docs/synthesizer-introduction).
:::

A row of dataset is called a `Golden`. When generating from documents, each golden contains an input (the user query), the expected output (ideal LLM response to user query), and the context (ideal context to be retrieved). A golden is different from an `LLMTestCase` because it does not require the actual output, which is generated at evaluation time.

You can access the list of goldens from the dataset object:

```python
print(dataset.goldens[0])
```

```python
Golden(
    input="Examine CloudMate's unique enterprise offerings: comprehensive compliance tools and dedicated support services."
    expected_output="""

## Reviewing the Synthetic Dataset

We'll be pushing our dataset to Confident AI for review. To do so, simply call the `push` method and give your dataset a unique name.

```python
dataset.push("MadeUpCompany QA Dataset")
```

:::info
While it's possible to manually inspect each golden, Confident AI allows you to review all the generated goldens at the same time, as well as **make edits, add annotations, and invite team members** (which is especially helpful if you have a customer support team helping you build the QA dataset).
:::

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
