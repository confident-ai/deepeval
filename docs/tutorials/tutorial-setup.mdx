In this tutorial series, we’ll guide you through using **DeepEval** and **Confident AI** to evaluate an agentic RAG application, from start to finish. DeepEval provides the foundation for evaluation, while Confident AI enhances its capabilities with tools for development, evaluation, and production monitoring.

## Installing DeepEval

Start by installing DeepEval using pip:

```bash
pip install deepeval
```

## Getting Your Confident AI API Key

Next, set up an account on **Confident AI**. You can [sign up here](https://www.confident-ai.com) or use the following CLI command if you already have DeepEval installed:

```bash
deepeval login
```

Navigate to your Settings page and copy your **Confident AI API Key** from the Project API Key box. If you used the `deepeval login` command to log in, you'll be prompted to paste your Confident AI API Key after creating an account.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://confident-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/tutorial_setup_01.svg"
    style={{
      marginTop: "20px",
      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

Alternatively, if you already have an account, you can log in directly using Python:

```python title="main.py"
deepeval.login_with_confident_api_key("your-confident-api-key")
```

Or through the CLI:

```bash
deepeval login --confident-api-key "your-confident-api-key"
```

With this, you’re all set up! With DeepEval and Confident AI configured, let’s begin building and evaluating our Agentic RAG application.
