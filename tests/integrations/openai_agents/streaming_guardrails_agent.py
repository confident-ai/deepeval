"""
This example shows how to use guardrails as the model is streaming. Output guardrails run after the
final output has been generated; this example runs guardails every N tokens, allowing for early
termination if bad output is detected.

The expected output is that you'll see a bunch of tokens stream in, then the guardrail will trigger
and stop the streaming.
