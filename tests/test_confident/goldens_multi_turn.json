That's key with the chain rule. Now let's tackle the product rule with g(x) = x²·sin(x). This rule says: derivative of first × second + first × derivative of second.

Once you have a shaggy dough that holds together, you'll knead it for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. It should feel like an earlobe when properly kneaded.

Use the heel of your hand to push the dough away from you, then fold it back over itself and give it a quarter turn. Repeat this motion - push, fold, turn. Your shoulders and arms should do the work, not just your hands. The 'earlobe test' is your best friend: pinch your earlobe, then pinch the dough - they should feel similarly soft and smooth. Also, try the 'poke test': poke the dough with your finger, and it should spring back slowly. After kneading, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes - this relaxes the gluten and makes rolling much easier."

You want it thin enough that you can almost see your hand through it - about 2-3mm thick. For cutting fettuccine, lightly flour the sheet, then loosely roll it up like a jelly roll. Use a sharp knife to cut 6-8mm wide strips, then unroll them and toss with a bit of flour to prevent sticking. The key is to work confidently but not rush - each sheet takes about 5-10 minutes to roll properly."

Fresh fettuccine typically cooks in just 2-3 minutes - it's done when it floats to the surface and has a tender but still slightly firm bite. Start testing after 90 seconds. The most important tip: save a cup of pasta cooking water before draining! That starchy water is liquid gold for binding your sauce to the pasta. Toss the hot, drained pasta immediately with your sauce and a splash of pasta water if needed. Fresh pasta is more delicate than dried, so be gentle when mixing. Your guests are going to be so impressed with your homemade fettuccine!"
