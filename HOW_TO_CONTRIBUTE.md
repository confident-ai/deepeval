# Contributing A Metric

To contribute a metric, we recommend looking at a metric file to see how it's done. To contribute a metric, we simply ask for 3 things:

- An `assert` statement so users know
- A `Metric` class so that this can be used in other areas of the codebase
- A test to make sure it works (just a simple one to get it working - we'll personally add more ourselves as time goes on as metrics become more important!)

And that's it!

# Making code changes / bug fixes

We kindly ask for code changes / bug fixes to be added to another test.

For most of these code-changes, a simple `black` is required to ensure good formatting.

We will be adding a few more additional developer tools for linting and code formatting purposes in the future.
